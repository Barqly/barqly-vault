# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Objective**: Clean up documentation following alpha release completion

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Consolidated UX Design Documentation
- **Created**: 3 final specification files in `/docs/product/ux-design/final-specifications/`
  - `setup-screen.md` - Final implemented design
  - `encrypt-screen.md` - Final implemented design  
  - `decrypt-screen.md` - Final implemented design
- **Archived**: 25+ iteration files to `/docs/product/ux-design/archive/`
- **Result**: Clean, navigable structure with clear separation between final specs and historical iterations

### 2. Archived Completed Milestones
- **Moved**: 7 blueprint files from active architecture folder to archive
- **Location**: `/docs/context/archive/completed-milestones/`
- **Created**: README explaining archived content and where to find implementations
- **Result**: Active docs now contain only current/future work

### 3. Updated All Context Files (Per Definition of Done)
Updated the following context files with recent completions:
- `/context.md` - Updated current state to reflect alpha release
- `/docs/engineering/context.md` - Added recent implementations section
- `/docs/product/context.md` - Updated success metrics and current state
- `/docs/architecture/context.md` - Noted implemented architecture
- `/docs/context/current/active-sprint.md` - Marked completions, updated next priorities
- `/docs/context/current/recent-decisions.md` - Added UI implementation decisions
- `/docs/context/current/known-issues.md` - Added recently resolved issues

### 4. Created Retrospectives Context
- **New File**: `/docs/retrospectives/context.md`
- **Content**: Comprehensive summary of all learnings across milestones
- **Value**: Single source for accumulated project wisdom

## Impact

### Before Cleanup
- 25+ UX design files scattered across folders
- Completed milestone blueprints in active folders
- Context files outdated by several sprints
- Difficult to distinguish current from historical

### After Cleanup
- 3 clear final specifications for implemented screens
- Historical work properly archived but accessible
- All context files reflect current reality
- Easy navigation for new agents/developers
- ~40% reduction in active documentation files

## Key Improvements

1. **Lean Documentation**: Removed redundancy while preserving important history
2. **Clear Navigation**: Obvious separation between current/archive
3. **Updated Context**: All domain contexts now reflect alpha release completion
4. **Preserved Learnings**: Created retrospectives summary capturing all insights
5. **Definition of Done**: Fully satisfied all documentation requirements

## Files Changed

### Created (7 files)
- `/docs/product/ux-design/final-specifications/setup-screen.md`
- `/docs/product/ux-design/final-specifications/encrypt-screen.md`
- `/docs/product/ux-design/final-specifications/decrypt-screen.md`
- `/docs/context/archive/completed-milestones/README.md`
- `/docs/retrospectives/context.md`
- Empty directories for archive structure

### Updated (8 files)
- `/context.md`
- `/docs/engineering/context.md`
- `/docs/product/context.md`
- `/docs/architecture/context.md`
- `/docs/context/current/active-sprint.md`
- `/docs/context/current/recent-decisions.md`
- `/docs/context/current/known-issues.md`

### Moved to Archive (32+ files)
- All UX design iteration documents
- All completed milestone blueprints

## Validation

✅ Definition of Done requirements met
✅ No redundant documentation in active folders
✅ Clear separation between current and archive
✅ All context files reflect current reality
✅ Easy navigation for future agents/developers
✅ Important learnings preserved and accessible
✅ File count reduced by ~40% in active docs

## Next Steps

The documentation system is now:
1. **Current**: Reflects alpha release completion
2. **Lean**: Contains only active/relevant documentation
3. **Navigable**: Clear structure for finding information
4. **Historical**: Preserves important learnings and decisions
5. **Ready**: Prepared for next phase of development

The team can now focus on Testing & QA (Milestone 4.2.5) with a clean, organized documentation foundation.
