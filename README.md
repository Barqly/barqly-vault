# Barqly Vault

**Status:** Alpha preview. macOS build tested; Windows & Linux builds in progress. Use at your own risk.

Barqly Vault is a minimal, open-source desktop tool to **encrypt sensitive data and documents** (for example, a Bitcoin output descriptor) before storing them in cloud or local backups.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** Barqly Vault is **not intended for private key or seed phrase storage**. It is designed for documents and configuration files that, if compromised, would not directly expose customer Bitcoin or other assets.



## Quickstart
1. Download a release binary from **Releases**.
2. Run the app and select files/folders to encrypt.
3. Choose output location; verify integrity manifest.

## Why
- Reduce risk when using cloud storage by pre-encrypting critical Bitcoin data.
- Simple UX, portable encryption, transparent integrity checks.

## Platforms
- macOS ‚úÖ  
- Windows üü° (help wanted)
