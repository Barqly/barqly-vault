## Detailed Risk Analysis

### 1. Security Risks

#### Dependency Vulnerabilities
- **Risk**: Known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Likelihood**: Low (0 current vulnerabilities)
- **Impact**: Critical
- **Mitigation**:
  ```bash
  # Automated scanning in CI/CD
  npm audit
  cargo audit  # Need to add
  ```
- **Status**: Well managed, add cargo-audit

#### Cryptographic Implementation
- **Risk**: Incorrect use of crypto libraries
- **Likelihood**: Very Low (using Age correctly)
- **Impact**: Critical
- **Mitigation**: Using high-level, audited Age library
- **Status**: âœ… Properly implemented

#### Supply Chain Attacks
- **Risk**: Compromised dependencies
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Lock files for reproducible builds
  - Minimal dependency tree
  - Regular security reviews
- **Status**: Partially mitigated

### 2. Technology Obsolescence Risks

#### Framework Longevity
| Technology | EOL Risk | Maintenance Status | Assessment |
|------------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Tauri v2 | Very Low | Very Active | âœ… Safe for 5+ years |
| React 18 | Very Low | Active, v19 available | âœ… Safe for 3+ years |
| Rust | None | Language standard | âœ… Safe indefinitely |
| Age | Low | Active development | âœ… Safe for 5+ years |

#### Migration Complexity
- **React 18 â†’ 19**: Low complexity (1-2 days)
- **Tauri v2 â†’ v3**: Unknown (likely low)
- **TypeScript versions**: Very low complexity
- **Overall**: Easy to keep current

### 3. Vendor Lock-in Risks

#### Technology Dependencies
| Component | Lock-in Risk | Alternative Options | Migration Effort |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Tauri | Low | Electron, Native | Medium (2-4 weeks) |
| React | Very Low | Vue, Svelte | Low (1-2 weeks) |
| Age | Low | GPG, Custom | Low (1 week) |
| Rust | None | C++, Go | High (rewrite) |

#### Data Format Lock-in
- **Risk**: Encrypted files unreadable
- **Mitigation**: Age is an open standard
- **Alternatives**: Can export/re-encrypt
- **Assessment**: âœ… No significant lock-in

### 4. Performance Risks

#### Scalability Limits
- **Current**: Handles files up to 1GB well
- **Risk**: May struggle with very large files (>10GB)
- **Likelihood**: Low (not the use case)
- **Mitigation**: Streaming encryption already implemented

#### Platform Performance Variations
- **Risk**: Poor performance on some platforms
- **Testing**: Validated on all target platforms
- **Assessment**: âœ… No significant risks

### 5. Maintenance Risks

#### Developer Availability
| Skill | Market Availability | Learning Curve | Risk Level |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------| 
| React | High | Low | ðŸŸ¢ Low |
| TypeScript | High | Low | ðŸŸ¢ Low |
| Rust | Medium | High | ðŸŸ¡ Medium |
| Tauri | Low-Medium | Medium | ðŸŸ¡ Medium |

#### Documentation Quality
- **Tauri**: Good official docs, growing community
- **Age**: Excellent specification, good examples
- **React/TypeScript**: Extensive resources
- **Overall**: Well documented stack

### 6. Business Continuity Risks

#### Project Abandonment
| Dependency | Bus Factor | Corporate Backing | Community | Risk |
|------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|------|
| Tauri | High | Yes (CrabNebula) | Growing | ðŸŸ¢ Low |
| React | Very High | Meta | Massive | ðŸŸ¢ Very Low |
| Age | Medium | FiloSottile | Good | ðŸŸ¡ Medium |
| Rust | Very High | Mozilla/Many | Large | ðŸŸ¢ Very Low |

#### Licensing Changes
- All core dependencies use permissive licenses
- No GPL contamination
- Low risk of licensing issues

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Implemented Mitigations

1. **Dependency Management**
   - âœ… Lock files for reproducibility
   - âœ… Minimal dependency tree
   - âœ… Regular update reviews

2. **Security Practices**
   - âœ… Automated testing
   - âœ… Code review process
   - âœ… Security-first architecture

3. **Documentation**
   - âœ… Comprehensive README
   - âœ… Inline code documentation
   - âœ… Architecture overview

### Recommended Additional Mitigations

#### Short-term (1-2 months)
1. **Add cargo-audit to CI/CD**
   ```yaml
   - name: Security Audit
     run: |
       cargo install cargo-audit
       cargo audit
   ```

2. **Create technology radar**
   - Track emerging alternatives
   - Plan migration paths
   - Document decision rationale

3. **Implement dependency policies**
   ```json
   {
     "policies": {
       "maxAge": "6 months",
       "securityUpdates": "immediate",
       "majorVersions": "quarterly review"
     }
   }
   ```

#### Long-term (6-12 months)
1. **Third-party security audit**
2. **Performance regression suite**
3. **Disaster recovery plan**
4. **Alternative implementation POCs**

## Contingency Plans

### If Tauri Development Stops
1. Continue using current version (stable)
2. Fork and maintain critical fixes
3. Plan migration to Electron (2-4 weeks)
4. Consider native implementation

### If Age Has Critical Vulnerability
1. Immediate patch if available
2. Implement additional encryption layer
3. Plan migration to libsodium
4. Provide migration tool for users

### If React Becomes Problematic
1. React is extremely stable, low risk
2. Could migrate to Preact (drop-in)
3. Or rewrite in Vue/Svelte (1-2 weeks)
