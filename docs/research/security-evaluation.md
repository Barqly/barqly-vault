## Cryptographic Security

### Encryption Implementation

| Component | Implementation | Security Level | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Cipher | Age (ChaCha20-Poly1305) | ✅ Excellent | Modern AEAD |
| Key derivation | scrypt | ✅ Excellent | Memory-hard |
| Random generation | OS CSPRNG | ✅ Excellent | Platform secure |
| Key format | Age standard | ✅ Excellent | Well-designed |

### Key Management Security

```rust
// Secure practices observed:
✅ Private keys never stored unencrypted
✅ Zeroization on drop (secrecy crate)
✅ Constant-time passphrase comparison
✅ No key material in logs
✅ Platform-specific secure storage
```

### Cryptographic Strengths
- **Modern algorithms**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 (no legacy crypto)
- **Proper authentication**: AEAD prevents tampering
- **Forward secrecy**: Each file uses unique key
- **No roll-your-own**: Uses audited Age library

## Application Security

### Memory Safety

| Feature | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Language | Rust | ✅ Prevents buffer overflows |
| Sensitive data | Zeroize crate | ✅ Clears on drop |
| Secret handling | Secrecy crate | ✅ Prevents logging |
| Ownership | Rust borrow checker | ✅ Prevents use-after-free |

### Input Validation

```typescript
// Frontend validation observed:
✅ Passphrase strength checking (zxcvbn)
✅ File path sanitization
✅ Size limits enforced
✅ Type checking (TypeScript strict)
```

```rust
// Backend validation observed:
✅ Command parameter validation
✅ Path traversal prevention
✅ Error handling without info leakage
✅ Resource limits enforced
```

### Tauri Security Configuration

```json
// CSP Policy Analysis:
{
  "csp": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-src 'none';"
}
✅ Restrictive CSP
✅ No remote content
✅ No eval() allowed
✅ No inline scripts
```

## Vulnerability Analysis

### Dependency Scanning Results

```bash
# Frontend (npm audit)
0 vulnerabilities ✅

# Backend (cargo-audit)
Not installed ⚠️ - Recommend adding
```

### Known Issues

1. **No cargo-audit**: Cannot scan Rust dependencies
2. **No secure deletion**: Files recoverable after deletion
3. **No rate limiting**: Passphrase brute force possible
4. **No tamper detection**: App binary not verified

### Third-Party Dependencies

| Dependency | Risk Level | Justification |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| age | Low | Audited, widely used |
| Tauri | Low | Active security team |
| React | Low | Mature, well-tested |
| zeroize | Low | Simple, focused scope |

## Security Testing Recommendations

### Immediate Testing Needs

1. **Penetration Testing**
   - Attempt key extraction
   - Test input validation
   - Try path traversal
   - Check error handling

2. **Fuzzing**
   ```bash
   # Recommended targets:
   - File parsing logic
   - Archive extraction
   - Command parameters
   ```

3. **Static Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Add to CI/CD:
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   cargo audit
   npm audit
   ```

### Security Monitoring

Implement logging for:
- Failed decryption attempts
- Invalid input patterns
- Resource exhaustion
- Unexpected errors

## Recommendations by Priority

### 🔴 Critical (Implement Immediately)

1. **Add cargo-audit**
   ```toml
   # In CI/CD workflow
   cargo install cargo-audit
   cargo audit
   ```

2. **Implement secure file deletion**
   ```rust
   // Overwrite before deletion
   use std::fs::OpenOptions;
   use rand::RngCore;
   
   fn secure_delete(path: &Path) -> Result<()> {
       let size = path.metadata()?.len();
       let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
           .write(true)
           .open(path)?;
       
       // Overwrite with random data
       let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
       let mut buffer = vec![0u8; 4096];
       
       for _ in 0..(size / 4096) + 1 {
           rng.fill_bytes(&mut buffer);
           file.write_all(&buffer)?;
       }
       
       file.sync_all()?;
       drop(file);
       fs::remove_file(path)?;
       Ok(())
   }
   ```

### 🟡 High Priority (Next Sprint)

1. **Rate limiting for passphrase attempts**
2. **Security event logging**
3. **Binary integrity verification**
4. **Clipboard clearing after copy**

### 🟢 Medium Priority (Future)

1. **Hardware key support (YubiKey)**
2. **Plausible deniability features**
3. **Emergency key destruction**
4. **Security audit by third party**
