- Comprehensive input validation
- Security-aware error handling
- Defense in depth approach

**Critical Findings:**
- Missing runtime integrity verification

## Cryptographic Security Analysis

### 1. Encryption Implementation

#### Age Encryption Library ✅ Excellent Choice
```rust
// Proper use of established library
age::Encryptor::with_recipients(vec![Box::new(recipient_key)])
```
- Uses well-audited age encryption standard
- No custom cryptographic implementations
- Proper streaming encryption for large files
- Forward secrecy through ephemeral keys

#### Key Generation ✅ Secure
```rust
pub fn generate_keypair() -> Result<KeyPair>
```
- Uses age's X25519 key generation
- Cryptographically secure random number generation
- Keys properly typed (PublicKey, PrivateKey)

#### Key Storage ✅ Well-designed
- Private keys always encrypted with passphrase
- Uses scrypt for key derivation (age default)
- Proper file permissions (600 on Unix)
- Keys stored in platform-specific secure locations

### 2. Memory Security

#### Sensitive Data Handling ✅
```rust
use secrecy::{ExposeSecret, SecretString};
pub struct PrivateKey(SecretString);
```
- Automatic memory zeroization via `secrecy` crate
- Private keys wrapped in SecretString
- Proper use of `expose_secret()` only when needed

#### Potential Issues ⚠️
- Passphrase comparison might not be constant-time
- Staging area files not securely wiped
- Decrypted data may remain in memory

### 3. Input Validation Security

#### Path Validation ✅
```rust
fn validate_path_security(path: &Path) -> Result<(), FileOpsError>
```
- Prevents path traversal attacks
- Validates against symbolic links
- Checks for hidden files
- Enforces size limits

#### Label Validation ✅
- Prevents path injection in key labels
- Sanitizes special characters
- Length limits enforced

### 4. Authentication & Authorization

#### Passphrase Security ⚠️ Mixed
**Strengths:**
- Minimum length requirements
- Complexity requirements enforced
- Never stored in plaintext

**Weaknesses:**
- No rate limiting on validation attempts
- Potential timing attacks in validation
- No account lockout mechanism
- Missing passphrase strength estimation

### 5. Error Handling Security

#### Information Disclosure ✅ Well-handled
```rust
pub struct CommandError {
    pub code: ErrorCode,
    pub message: String,  // User-friendly, no secrets
    pub details: Option<String>,  // Technical, still safe
}
```
- No sensitive data in error messages
- Separate user vs technical messages
- Proper error categorization

### 6. File Operation Security

#### Archive Security ✅
- Manifest includes SHA-256 hashes
- Integrity verification on decryption
- Atomic operations prevent partial writes

#### Temporary File Handling ⚠️ Risk
- Staging directory not securely wiped
- Temporary files may persist after crashes
- No secure deletion implementation

## Application Security Analysis

### 1. Tauri Security Configuration

#### Content Security Policy ✅
```json
"csp": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self';"
```
- Restrictive CSP prevents XSS
- No unsafe-inline allowed
- External resources blocked

#### Window Security ⚠️
- DevTools enabled in production
- Should be disabled for release builds

### 2. Frontend Security

#### Type Safety ✅
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Runtime validation for API responses
- Proper error boundaries

#### State Management ✅
- No global state for sensitive data
- Keys never stored in frontend
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

### 3. Communication Security

#### IPC Security ✅
- Type-safe Tauri commands
- Input validation at boundary
- No arbitrary code execution

#### Network Security ✅
- No network operations (offline-first)
- No external dependencies at runtime
- No telemetry or analytics
