# üé® Design Brief: Barqly Brand Identity

## 1. Context

Barqly is a Bitcoin-first company building secure, halal custody solutions for both individuals and institutions.

Our journey roadmap:

* **Barqly Vault (open source)** ‚Üí a desktop app to encrypt Bitcoin-related documents (first public milestone, trust builder).
* **Barqly Wallet (BarqPay, private app)** ‚Üí a self-custody Bitcoin wallet (next release, mass adoption focus).
* **Barqly Custody (BarqX, private platform)** ‚Üí institutional-grade custody product (future offering).

We want a **cohesive brand identity** where Barqly (parent) and its products (Vault, Wallet, Custody) feel related but not identical.

## 3. Technical Requirements

* **Vector Source Files:** SVG/AI for all logos
* **Raster Exports:** PNG in 32√ó32, 128√ó128, 256√ó256
* **Platform Icons:**

  * macOS: `.icns` (generated from PNGs)
  * Windows: `.ico` (generated from PNGs)
  * Linux: uses PNGs directly

## 4. Branding Notes

* **Consistency:** Vault logo should visually ‚Äúlive under‚Äù the Barqly parent brand (same design DNA).
* **Flexibility:** Parent Barqly logo should be simple and future-proof so it can also represent Wallet (BarqPay) and Custody (BarqX) without needing separate logos.
* **Color Palette:** Dark grey base, orange accent (lightning bolt), optional gradient tones for depth.
* **Adaptive:** Prefer one adaptive design that works on both light and dark themes.
