# Completed Milestones Archive

This directory contains blueprints and specifications for completed milestones. These documents are preserved for historical reference and traceability.

## Archived Milestones

### Milestone 2: Core Rust Modules

- `blueprint-milestone2.md` - Overview of crypto, storage, and file_ops modules
- `blueprint-milestone2-task3.md` - Detailed file operations specifications

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested

### Milestone 3: Tauri Command Bridge

- `blueprint-milestone3.md` - Command bridge architecture
- `blueprint-milestone3-task3.1.md` - Setup command specifications
- `blueprint-milestone3-task3.2.md` - Encryption command specifications
- `blueprint-milestone3-task3.3.md` - Decryption command specifications
- `blueprint-milestone3-task3.4.md` - Integration testing plan

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and integrated

## Why These Are Archived

These blueprints served their purpose during active development. The implementations now live in:

- `/src-tauri/src/` - Rust backend implementation
- `/src-ui/src/` - Frontend implementation
- `/docs/architecture/context.md` - Current architecture summary

## Accessing Implementation

To see the current implementation of these blueprints:

```bash
# View Rust modules
ls src-tauri/src/modules/

# View Tauri commands
grep -r "#\[tauri::command\]" src-tauri/src/

# View TypeScript API usage
grep -r "invoke(" src-ui/src/
```

## Historical Value

These documents preserve:

- Original design decisions and rationale
- Evolution of the architecture
- Requirements that drove implementation
- Testing strategies that were planned
