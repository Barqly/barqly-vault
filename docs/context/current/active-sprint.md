## Quick Commands

```bash
# Validation before commit
make validate       # Full validation (matches CI)
make validate-ui    # Frontend only (~30s)
make validate-rust  # Backend only (~1-2min)

# Development
make ui            # Start frontend dev server
make app           # Start desktop application
make dev-keys      # Generate sample keys
make dev-reset     # Reset dev environment
```
