# Research & Evaluation Extraction and Archive Plan

## Executive Summary
Strategic plan to extract timeless insights from completed Research and Evaluation domains (one-time assessments at 30% project completion) and archive the detailed assessments, reducing active context weight while preserving essential wisdom.

## Current State Analysis

### Research Domain (One-Time Exercise)
- **When**: Project transition from CursorAI to Claude Code at 30% completion
- **Who**: Research Engineer
- **Status**: Complete - all recommendations implemented
- **Files**: 8 documents totaling ~500 lines of historical assessment

### Evaluation Domain (One-Time Assessment)  
- **When**: Same transition point (30% completion)
- **Who**: System Architect
- **Status**: Complete - all quick wins, security fixes, and debt payments implemented
- **Files**: 6 documents totaling ~600 lines of point-in-time analysis

## Extraction Strategy

### Phase 1: Identify Timeless Insights

#### From Research Domain - Extract to Architecture Context
**Technology Stack Rationale** (Timeless)
- Why Tauri over Electron (34x smaller, 2.5x less memory)
- Why Age over GPG (70% less code, simpler API)
- Why Rust for crypto (memory safety guarantees)
- Cross-platform validation results

**Security Principles** (Timeless)
- Offline-first architecture eliminates remote attacks
- Memory zeroization requirements
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm choice rationale
- Supply chain security approach

**Performance Baselines** (Timeless)
- 90-second UX workflow target and validation
- 10MB/s encryption speed requirement and achievement
- <2 second startup, <200MB memory targets

#### From Evaluation Domain - Extract to Common/Standards
**Quality Standards** (Timeless)
- Definition of Done criteria that emerged
- Security hardening checklist
- Code quality metrics (coverage >90%, complexity <10)
- Architectural principles (abstraction, DI, domain modeling)

**Technical Debt Philosophy** (Timeless)
- ROI-driven debt payment strategy
- Security debt = immediate payment
- Architectural debt = quarterly payment
- Code quality debt = pay when touched

### Phase 2: Create Consolidated Documents

#### 1. Technology Decisions Record (NEW)
**Location**: `/docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md`
**Content**: 
- Stack choices with rationale
- Accepted trade-offs
- Migration paths if needed
- Version strategy

#### 2. Security Foundations (ENHANCE)
**Location**: `/docs/common/security-foundations.md`
**Content**:
- Core security principles from research
- Validated threat model
- Cryptographic choices
- Attack surface analysis

#### 3. Quality Standards (ENHANCE)
**Location**: `/docs/common/quality-standards.md`
**Content**:
- Consolidated Definition of Done
- Performance baselines
- Code quality metrics
- Technical debt strategy

### Phase 3: Archive Historical Assessments

#### Create Archive Structure
```
/docs/archive/
├── project-transition-30pct/
│   ├── README.md (context about the transition)
│   ├── research-assessment/
│   │   ├── compatibility-assessment.md
│   │   ├── performance-benchmarks.md
│   │   ├── risk-assessment.md
│   │   ├── security-evaluation.md
│   │   ├── stack-validation.md
│   │   ├── technology-analysis.md
│   │   ├── version-recommendations.md
│   │   └── context.md
│   └── evaluation-assessment/
│       ├── architecture-assessment.md
│       ├── quick-wins.md
│       ├── refactoring-roadmap.md
│       ├── security-audit.md
│       ├── technical-debt-analysis.md
│       └── context.md
```

### Phase 4: Update Active Contexts

#### Remove from Active Context Loading
- Remove `/docs/research/` from active context
- Remove `/docs/evaluation/` from active context
- Add references to new consolidated documents

#### Update Domain Contexts
- Architecture domain: Reference technology-decisions.md
- Common domain: Reference enhanced standards
- Include "For historical context, see /docs/archive/project-transition-30pct/"

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Consolidated Documents (30 min)
1. Create technology-decisions.md with stack rationale
2. Enhance security-foundations.md with research findings
3. Enhance quality-standards.md with evaluation insights

### Step 2: Create Archive Structure (15 min)
1. Create /docs/archive/ directory structure
2. Add README explaining the 30% transition context
3. Move research and evaluation files to archive

### Step 3: Update References (15 min)
1. Update architecture/context.md to reference new documents
2. Update common/context.md to reference enhanced standards
3. Add archive references where appropriate

### Step 4: Validate and Clean (15 min)
1. Ensure no broken links
2. Verify all timeless insights captured
3. Confirm archive is complete
4. Remove original directories

## Success Criteria

### Context Weight Reduction
- **Before**: ~1100 lines of historical assessment in active context
- **After**: ~300 lines of timeless insights in active context
- **Reduction**: 73% less context to process

### Information Preservation
- ✅ All technology rationale preserved
- ✅ All security principles captured
- ✅ All quality standards consolidated
- ✅ Historical record maintained in archive

### Improved Actionability
- Active context focuses on "what to do now"
- Historical context available when needed for "why we chose X"
- Clear separation between living standards and completed assessments

## Risk Mitigation

### Information Loss Risk
- **Mitigation**: Complete archive before deletion
- **Validation**: Cross-reference extraction checklist

### Reference Breaking Risk
- **Mitigation**: Update all domain contexts
- **Validation**: Search for broken links

### Context Confusion Risk
- **Mitigation**: Clear README in archive explaining context
- **Validation**: Timestamp and purpose documentation

## Timeline
- **Total Effort**: 1.5 hours
- **When**: Immediate - these assessments are stale and adding weight
- **Who**: ZenMaster with System Architect review

## Decision
**Recommended Action**: Proceed with extraction and archival immediately. The research and evaluation domains have served their purpose as transition assessments. Their timeless insights should be preserved in living documents while the point-in-time findings should be archived for historical reference.

This approach:
1. Reduces active context weight by 73%
2. Preserves all valuable insights in appropriate locations
3. Maintains historical record for future reference
4. Improves context actionability and relevance
