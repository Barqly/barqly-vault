# Barqly Vault

**Simple, secure file encryption for Bitcoin users**

---

## What is Barqly Vault?

Barqly Vault is a simple, secure desktop app that lets you encrypt and backup your most important digital files - like Bitcoin wallet recovery information, family documents, or any sensitive data you need to protect.

## The Problem it Solves

When you practice Bitcoin self-custody or have sensitive family documents, you need a reliable way to create secure backups that you control completely. Most people either use complex tools that are hard to use, or they risk their security by using cloud storage or unencrypted backups.

## How it Works

1. **Setup**: You create a secure "key" (like a digital lock) with a passphrase you remember
2. **Encrypt**: You select files or folders, choose your key, and the app creates an encrypted backup
3. **Decrypt**: When you need your files back, you use your key and passphrase to unlock them

## Key Benefits

- **Simple**: Three clear steps - setup, encrypt, decrypt
- **Secure**: Uses military-grade encryption (age standard) that's trusted by security experts
- **Self-Controlled**: Your files never leave your computer unless you choose to move them
- **Cross-Platform**: Works the same way on Mac, Windows, and Linux
- **Reliable**: Preserves folder structure and includes integrity checks to ensure your files are safe

## Target Users

- Bitcoin users who need to backup wallet recovery information
- Families creating inheritance plans with sensitive documents
- Anyone who wants simple, secure file encryption without technical complexity

## The Promise

Take the security of professional-grade encryption and make it as easy to use as any other desktop app. No cloud dependencies, no technical knowledge required - just secure, reliable file protection you control.
