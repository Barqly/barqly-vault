# Operations Context

## Domain Overview

The Operations domain captures production readiness planning and deployment automation for Barqly Vault. While currently in early stages (pre-production), this domain establishes the foundation for future operational excellence.

## Current State

### CI/CD Foundation (Active)
- **GitHub Actions** workflows for frontend and backend validation
- **Makefile automation** providing comprehensive validation (`make validate`)
- **Pre-commit hooks** ensuring quality gates at developer level
- **Cross-platform build** capabilities via Tauri

### Key Finding
The project has **95% CI-ready automation** with excellent local validation that mirrors CI exactly. The gap is not automation itself, but production deployment and cross-platform testing.

## Future Operations Stack

### Phase 1: Enhanced CI/CD (Next)
```yaml
Priority: Cross-platform testing matrix
- Windows, macOS, Linux build validation
- Automated artifact management
- Integration with existing make validate
```

### Phase 2: Release Automation (Future)
```yaml
Priority: Production deployment pipeline
- Semantic versioning automation
- Multi-platform distribution
- Automated changelog generation
```

### Phase 3: Production Operations (Long-term)
```yaml
Priority: Operational excellence
- Monitoring and alerting
- Performance benchmarking
- Incident response playbooks
- Security scanning integration
```

## Integration Points

### With Engineering Domain
- Leverage `make validate` as single source of truth
- Build artifacts feed from engineering validation
- Performance benchmarks from `make bench`

### With Security Domain
- Security scanning in CI pipeline
- Compliance validation gates
- Audit logging integration

## Operational Principles

1. **Leverage Existing Excellence**: Build on the 95% CI-ready automation
2. **Maintain Local/CI Parity**: `make validate` remains source of truth
3. **Incremental Enhancement**: Add capabilities without disrupting workflows
4. **Cross-Platform First**: Desktop app requires multi-OS validation

## Current Documentation

- `ci-cd-analysis.md` - Comprehensive analysis of current state and recommendations
- `operations-playbook.md` - Placeholder for future operational procedures

## Evolution Path

```
Current State          →  Near-term           →  Production
GitHub Actions            Enhanced CI/CD          Full DevOps
Single OS testing        Cross-platform          Multi-region
Manual releases          Automated releases      Continuous deployment
Local validation         CI validation           Production monitoring
```

## Key Decisions

- **Recommended**: Lightweight CI/CD integration (Option A from analysis)
- **Preserve**: Existing make-based automation
- **Priority**: Cross-platform testing before production release
- **Defer**: Complex monitoring until post-launch

## Next Actions

When development completes and production deployment begins:
1. Implement cross-platform CI matrix
2. Add artifact management pipeline
3. Create release automation workflow
4. Develop incident response playbooks
5. Establish monitoring strategy

*Note: This domain will expand significantly as the project moves from development to production deployment. Current focus remains on establishing CI/CD foundation that leverages existing automation excellence.*
