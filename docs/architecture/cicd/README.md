## 📋 Common Release Tasks

### App Release (Most Common)

```bash
# Test build (skips notarization, saves $)
git tag v0.2.0-test.1 && git push origin v0.2.0-test.1

# Beta build (full notarization)
git tag v0.2.0-beta.1 && git push origin v0.2.0-beta.1

# Promote to production
make promote-beta FROM=0.2.0-beta.1 TO=0.2.0

# Publish production
make publish-prod VERSION=0.2.0
```

**Full details:** [release-process.md](./release-process.md)

### Binary Dependency Update (Rare - Every 3-6 Months)

```bash
# 1. Download age/age-plugin binaries
./scripts/cicd/download-all-binaries.sh

# 2. Build ykman for all platforms
gh workflow run build-ykman-bundles.yml -f version=5.8.0
gh run watch

# 3. Download and organize
gh run download <run-id> --dir dist/ykman-temp
mv dist/ykman-temp/*/*.tar.gz dist/binaries/

# 4. Update GitHub Release
cd dist/binaries
gh release delete barqly-vault-dependencies --yes  # If updating
gh release create barqly-vault-dependencies \
  age-* age-plugin-yubikey-* ykman-* checksums.txt \
  --title "Barqly Vault Binary Dependencies" \
  --prerelease

# 5. Update binary-dependencies.json with new versions/checksums
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Release Types

```
Alpha Tags    → Checkpoints only (no builds)
  ↓
Test Tags     → Full build, no notarization (testing)
  ↓
Beta Tags     → Full build + notarization (user testing)
  ↓
Production    → Promoted from beta (manual gate)
```

### Binary Flow

```
GitHub Release: barqly-vault-dependencies
  ↓
fetch-binaries.sh (downloads to src-tauri/bin/)
  ↓
Tauri bundles into app packages
  ↓
DMG/MSI/AppImage with embedded binaries
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Build fails on test tag | Check `.github/workflows/release.yml` logs |
| Binary not found in app | Verify `fetch-binaries.sh` ran in CI |
| Notarization fails | Check "Status = Invalid" logs for specific files. Common: unsigned .so files, broken Python.framework symlinks |
| ykman build fails | Check platform dependencies in `build-ykman-bundles.yml` |
| Checksums mismatch | Old cache restored. Clear Actions cache or wait for fresh download |
| "Bad CPU type" on Intel Mac | Architecture mismatch. Verify `TARGET_ARCH=intel` in workflow, check architecture verification step |
| ykman hangs on Intel (macOS 15.6) | Library Validation issue. Verify entitlements: `codesign -d --entitlements - ykman` |
| Python.framework signature invalid | Tauri bug #13219 - symlinks dereferenced. Verify symlink restoration step ran |
