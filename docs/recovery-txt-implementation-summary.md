# RECOVERY.txt Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Implementer:** Backend Engineer
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Changes Implemented

### Problem Solved
Previously, RECOVERY.txt was bundled INSIDE the encrypted .age file, creating a chicken & egg problem where users couldn't read recovery instructions until they'd already decrypted the file. This made the recovery instructions useless for actual recovery scenarios.

### Solution Implemented
RECOVERY.txt is now written OUTSIDE the encrypted bundle as a plaintext file alongside the .age file, making it immediately readable without decryption.

---

## New File Structure

### After Encryption
```
~/Documents/Barqly-Vaults/
  ├── Sam-Family-Vault.age              ← Encrypted bundle
  ├── Sam-Family-Vault.manifest         ← Metadata (non-sync storage)
  └── Sam-Family-Vault-RECOVERY.txt     ← NEW: Plaintext recovery guide
```

### Inside .age Bundle (encrypted TAR.GZ)
```
vault.tar.gz (encrypted)
  ├── user-files/                       ← User's files
  ├── Sam-Family-Vault.manifest         ← Manifest copy
  ├── MBP-2024-Family-Key.agekey.enc   ← Passphrase keys
  └── [RECOVERY.txt REMOVED]            ← No longer inside!
```

## Lifecycle Management

### Creation
- RECOVERY.txt is created AFTER successful .age file encryption
- Written to the same directory as the .age file (Barqly-Vaults)
- Non-fatal if creation fails (logged as warning, vault still works)

### Deletion
- When a vault is deleted, the system now deletes:
  1. The .age encrypted file
  2. The .manifest metadata file
  3. The -RECOVERY.txt instructions file
- Pattern: `{sanitized_name}-RECOVERY.txt`

---

## Code Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. **payload_staging_service.rs**
   - Removed RECOVERY.txt from bundle staging (lines 85-93)
   - Added `write_recovery_file()` method to write outside bundle

2. **vault_bundle_encryption_service.rs**
   - Added call to `write_recovery_file()` after encryption (step 11)
   - Non-fatal error handling if RECOVERY.txt creation fails

3. **recovery_txt_service.rs**
   - Updated content generation to remove sensitive info
   - Shows only last 4 digits of YubiKey serials
   - Removed firmware, machine ID, slot info
   - Added link to barqly.com/recovery
   - Improved formatting and structure

4. **vault_persistence.rs**
   - Added RECOVERY.txt deletion when vault is deleted
   - Deletes `{sanitized_name}-RECOVERY.txt` alongside .age file

5. **Test files**
   - Updated all tests to match new format
   - All tests passing ✅

---

## Testing Completed

- ✅ Unit tests for recovery text generation
- ✅ Unit tests for payload staging (without RECOVERY.txt in bundle)
- ✅ Format validation (make validate-rust)
- ✅ All 305 library tests passing

---

## Frontend Impact

### No Breaking Changes
- Existing encryption/decryption workflows unchanged
- All APIs remain the same
- Only the placement and content of RECOVERY.txt changed

### User Benefits
1. **Recovery instructions now actually useful** - Can read BEFORE decrypting
2. **Privacy improved** - Minimal sensitive info exposed
3. **Better UX** - Clear instructions with online guide link
4. **Professional appearance** - Well-formatted, helpful content

---

## Next Steps for Frontend Team

### Website Documentation Needed
Create `/recovery` page at https://barqly.com/recovery with:
- Generic recovery instructions (no vault-specific info)
- YubiKey recovery workflow
- Passphrase key recovery workflow
- Troubleshooting guide
- Support contact

### No UI Changes Required
The frontend doesn't need any changes - this is purely a backend improvement that enhances the user experience during manual recovery scenarios.

---

## Summary

✅ **RECOVERY.txt successfully moved outside encrypted bundle**
✅ **Privacy-sensitive information removed**
✅ **User-friendly improvements added**
✅ **Deletion lifecycle properly handled**
✅ **All tests passing**
✅ **Ready for R2 release**

The implementation follows all DRY principles, uses existing patterns, and maintains backward compatibility (no migration needed as we have no users yet).
