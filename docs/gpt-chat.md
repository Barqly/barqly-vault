Here’s the **Setup ↔ Encrypt consistency checklist** you can hand to your engineer for polish:

---

### **1. Step Indicator Styling**

* **Goal:** Make the current/active step more prominent so it pops visually.
* **Action Items:**

  * Match the active-step styling logic from Setup’s active tab (blue text or stronger weight).
  * Keep inactive steps the same lighter tone for visual hierarchy.

---

### **2. Button Consistency**

* **Goal:** Ensure all buttons feel identical in style and spacing across screens.
* **Action Items:**

  * **Primary buttons** (“Create Key,” “Encrypt Now”): same fill color, hover state, font size, padding, border radius.
  * **Secondary buttons** (“Previous,” “Clear”): same border color, text weight, padding, and corner radius.
  * Ensure vertical alignment with form content is consistent.

---

### **3. Success Message Wording**

* **Goal:** Match tone with the tagline’s approachable, reassuring style.
* **Action Items:**

  * Change “Vault Successfully Created!” → **“Your vault is ready — strong encryption applied.”**
  * Keep the subtext (“Strong encryption applied”) but merge it into one friendly line if possible.

---

### **4. Microcopy Alignment**

* **Goal:** Match style for small descriptive/help text across screens.
* **Action Items:**

  * Setup’s **“Keys stay on this device”** vs. Encrypt’s **“External manifest provides readable vault contents for verification”** should:

    * Use the same font size & weight.
    * Use the same grey color tone.
    * Match vertical spacing above/below this microcopy.

---

This way, your Setup and Encrypt screens will feel *pixel-perfect matched*, and users will experience them as part of a single, seamless workflow.
