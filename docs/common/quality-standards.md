## Quality Metrics and Targets

### Code Coverage Requirements
| Component | Minimum Coverage | Target Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Cryptographic operations | 90% | 95% | Security critical |
| File operations | 80% | 90% | Core functionality |
| UI components | 70% | 80% | User interactions |
| Utilities | 60% | 70% | Helper functions |
| Error handling | 85% | 90% | Reliability critical |

### Performance Requirements
| Metric | Minimum | Target | Maximum |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Startup time | 2.0s | 1.5s | 3.0s |
| Encryption speed | 10 MB/s | 20 MB/s | - |
| Memory usage (idle) | - | 120MB | 200MB |
| Memory usage (active) | - | 200MB | 500MB |
| UI response time | - | 100ms | 200ms |
| Bundle size | - | 5MB | 50MB |

### Reliability Standards
- **Error rate**: <0.1% of operations
- **Crash rate**: <0.01% of sessions  
- **Data loss**: Zero tolerance
- **Recovery time**: <5 seconds from error
- **Availability**: 99.9% (local app)

## Technical Debt Philosophy

### Investment Decision Framework
**Accept debt when:**
- Time-to-market is critical for user safety
- Proof of concept needed for validation
- External dependency requires workaround
- Clear payback timeline exists (<3 months)

**Reject debt when:**
- Security would be compromised
- Data integrity at risk
- User experience significantly degraded
- Maintenance cost exceeds development time

### Debt Tracking and Management
```markdown
## Technical Debt Record
**ID**: TD-2025-001
**Component**: File selection UI
**Type**: Performance optimization
**Impact**: Medium - 200ms delay on large directories
**Effort**: 2 days
**Priority**: P2
**Payback**: Improved UX for power users
**Decision**: Accept - schedule for next sprint
```

### Debt Reduction Strategy
1. **20% rule** - Allocate 20% of sprint to debt reduction
2. **Boy Scout rule** - Leave code better than found
3. **Refactor on touch** - Improve when modifying
4. **Debt sprints** - Quarterly focused cleanup
5. **Sunset planning** - Schedule obsolete code removal

## Testing Standards

### Test Types and Coverage
| Test Type | Purpose | Coverage Target | Frequency |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Unit | Component logic | 80% | Every commit |
| Integration | Module interaction | 70% | Every commit |
| E2E | User workflows | Critical paths | Daily |
| Performance | Speed/memory | Baselines | Weekly |
| Security | Vulnerability | 100% critical | Every commit |
| Smoke | Deployment | Basic flows | Every release |

### Test Quality Principles
- **Fast** - Unit tests <10ms, integration <100ms
- **Isolated** - No test dependencies or order
- **Repeatable** - Same result every run
- **Self-validating** - Clear pass/fail
- **Timely** - Written with or before code

### Testing Best Practices
```rust
// Descriptive test names
#[test]
fn encrypt_file_with_valid_key_succeeds() { }

// Clear Arrange-Act-Assert
#[test]
fn test_key_generation() {
    // Arrange: Set up test data
    let passphrase = "test-pass";
    
    // Act: Execute the operation
    let result = generate_key(passphrase);
    
    // Assert: Verify expectations
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}

// Property-based testing for edge cases
#[quickcheck]
fn prop_encrypt_decrypt_roundtrip(data: Vec<u8>) -> bool {
    let encrypted = encrypt(&data).unwrap();
    let decrypted = decrypt(&encrypted).unwrap();
    data == decrypted
}
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Quality Feedback Loops
1. **Build metrics** - Track build times, failure rates
2. **Test metrics** - Coverage trends, flaky tests
3. **Performance metrics** - Regression detection
4. **User metrics** - Error rates, performance
5. **Developer metrics** - Cycle time, review time

### Quality Gates
**Pre-commit**: `make validate-ui` or `make validate-rust`
**Pre-push**: `make validate`
**Pull Request**: Full CI pipeline
**Pre-release**: Security scan, performance test
**Post-release**: Monitor metrics, user feedback

### Improvement Process
1. **Measure** - Establish baselines
2. **Analyze** - Identify bottlenecks
3. **Improve** - Implement changes
4. **Verify** - Confirm improvement
5. **Standardize** - Update practices
