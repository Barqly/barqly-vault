# Evaluation Domain Context

## Purpose & Strategic Value

The Evaluation domain serves as Barqly Vault's objective health monitoring system, providing continuous assessment of architecture quality, security posture, and technical debt. This domain bridges the gap between current reality and future excellence through honest assessment and prioritized improvement strategies.

## Domain Overview

### What This Domain Provides
- **Objective Health Assessment**: Unbiased evaluation of codebase strengths and weaknesses
- **Security Assurance**: Continuous vulnerability assessment for Bitcoin custody requirements
- **ROI-Driven Improvements**: Prioritized enhancements based on effort vs. impact analysis
- **Technical Debt Management**: Investment-grade decisions on when to pay down debt
- **Continuous Evolution**: Transformation of critique into actionable improvements

### Core Philosophy
"Measure twice, cut once" - Every evaluation leads to specific, actionable improvements with clear success metrics and implementation guidance.

## Current State Assessment

### Overall Health Score: 8.2/10

#### Strengths (What's Working Well)
- **Security Foundation**: Proper use of audited age encryption library
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured modules with clear separation of concerns
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system + explicit zeroization for sensitive data
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from Rust to TypeScript
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive, user-friendly error messages without information leakage
- **Testing Coverage**: Solid unit and integration test foundation

#### Critical Gaps (Immediate Action Required)
1. **Missing Runtime Security**
   - No integrity verification (application tampering possible)
   - No secure file deletion (sensitive data recoverable)
   - No rate limiting (brute force attacks possible)
   
2. **Architectural Coupling**
   - Direct dependencies on concrete implementations
   - Missing abstraction layers for crypto operations
   - No dependency injection framework

3. **Incomplete Features**
   - Configuration module not implemented
   - Key rotation capability missing
   - Audit logging absent

## Prioritized Improvement Roadmap

### Sprint 1: Security Hardening (Week 1-2)
**Theme**: "Lock the doors and windows"

#### Critical Security Fixes (Do Today)
```rust
// 1. Disable DevTools in Production (15 minutes)
// Impact: Prevents runtime inspection
"devtools": false  // tauri.conf.json

// 2. Add Security Headers (30 minutes)
// Impact: Enhanced XSS protection
"csp": "default-src 'self'; ... frame-ancestors 'none';"

// 3. Extract Magic Numbers (1 hour)
// Impact: Maintainable security parameters
const MIN_PASSPHRASE_LENGTH: usize = 12;
const KEY_DERIVATION_ITERATIONS: u32 = 100_000;
```

#### P0 Security Implementations (3-5 days)
1. **Secure File Deletion** (Critical)
   - Platform-specific secure wipe implementation
   - Three-pass overwrite with random data
   - Staging area automatic cleanup
   
2. **Rate Limiting** (Critical)
   - Exponential backoff for passphrase attempts
   - Account lockout after threshold
   - Time-based unlock mechanism

3. **Constant-Time Operations** (High)
   - Use `subtle` crate for comparisons
   - Audit all crypto-related validations
   - Prevent timing attack vulnerabilities

### Sprint 2-3: Architecture Evolution (Week 3-5)
**Theme**: "Build for the future without breaking the present"

#### Abstraction Layer Introduction
```rust
// Transform tight coupling into flexible interfaces
pub trait CryptoProvider {
    fn encrypt(&self, data: &[u8], recipient: &PublicKey) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
    fn decrypt(&self, data: &[u8], key: &PrivateKey) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
}

pub trait KeyStorage {
    fn save(&self, label: &str, key: &[u8]) -> Result<PathBuf>;
    fn load(&self, label: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
}
```

#### Dependency Injection Framework
- Implement service container for testability
- Enable mock implementations for testing
- Support runtime configuration changes

#### Audit Logging System
- Security event tracking
- Forensic capability for incident response
- Tamper-proof log storage

### Sprint 4-5: Technical Excellence (Week 6-8)
**Theme**: "Polish the diamond"

#### Domain Model Layer
- Business logic separation from infrastructure
- Policy enforcement at domain boundary
- Clear value objects and entities

#### Performance Optimizations
- Implement strategic caching (LRU for key metadata)
- Add lazy loading for UI components
- Enable concurrent file processing

#### Comprehensive Testing
- Add missing edge case coverage
- Implement property-based testing
- Create chaos testing scenarios
