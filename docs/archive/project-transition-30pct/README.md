# Project Transition Archive (30% Completion Point)

## Context
This archive contains the comprehensive assessments performed when the Barqly Vault project transitioned from CursorAI to Claude Code at approximately 30% completion (early December 2024).

## What's Archived Here

### Research Domain Assessment
- **Performed by**: Research Engineer subagent
- **Purpose**: Validate technology stack and provide evidence-based recommendations
- **Status**: All recommendations implemented
- **Key Decisions Made**:
  - Validated Tauri v2 over Electron
  - Confirmed Age encryption over GPG
  - Approved React 18 (deferred React 19)
  - Validated Rust for all cryptographic operations

### Evaluation Domain Assessment  
- **Performed by**: System Architect subagent
- **Purpose**: Assess architecture, identify technical debt, prioritize improvements
- **Status**: All critical issues resolved, quick wins implemented
- **Key Improvements Made**:
  - Security hardening completed
  - Test infrastructure rebuilt
  - Architecture patterns established
  - Technical debt reduced from 5.5/10 to 3.5/10

## Why This is Archived
These assessments served their purpose as point-in-time evaluations. The timeless insights have been extracted to:
- `/docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md` - Technology choices and rationale
- `/docs/common/security-foundations.md` - Security principles and requirements
- `/docs/common/quality-standards.md` - Quality metrics and standards

## When to Reference This Archive
- Understanding why specific technology choices were made
- Reviewing the project's evolution from manual to AI-driven development
- Analyzing how technical debt was identified and addressed
- Learning from the transition methodology for future projects

## Historical Significance
This transition point marks when Barqly Vault evolved from a traditional development approach to full Agent-Driven Development (ADD) using the ZenAI framework. The assessments captured here enabled a smooth transition and established the quality baselines that continue to guide the project.
