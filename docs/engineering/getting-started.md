## üì± **User Quick Start Guide**

Barqly Vault makes secure file encryption simple. Follow these three steps to protect your important files.

### Step 1: Setup Your Encryption Key

1. **Launch Barqly Vault** on your computer
2. **Create a new key** with a memorable name (e.g., "Family Backup Key")
3. **Choose a strong passphrase** - this is your digital password
4. **Save your key** - it's now ready to use

_üí° Tip: Choose a passphrase you'll remember but others won't guess_

### Step 2: Encrypt Your Files

1. **Select files or folders** you want to protect
2. **Choose your encryption key** from the dropdown
3. **Pick a destination** for your encrypted backup
4. **Click "Encrypt"** - that's it!

_‚úÖ Your files are now securely encrypted and ready for backup_

### Step 3: Decrypt When Needed

1. **Select your encrypted file** (.age extension)
2. **Choose the key** you used for encryption
3. **Enter your passphrase**
4. **Pick where to save** the decrypted files
5. **Click "Decrypt"** - your files are restored!
