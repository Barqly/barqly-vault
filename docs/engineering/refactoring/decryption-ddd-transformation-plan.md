### Milestone 4.1: Complete UnifiedKeyListService ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Backup original file to `docs/engineering/backups/unified_keys_original.rs`
- [x] Analyze 683-line file: 6 types, 3 converters, 5 list functions, 2 operations
- [x] Identify architectural violations:
  - Direct `KeyRegistry::load()` calls (3 occurrences)
  - `remove_key_from_vault` duplicates `KeyRegistryService.detach_key_from_vault()`
  - `update_key_label` should use `KeyRegistryService.update_key()`
- [x] Create `UnifiedKeyListService` (~270 lines) in `services/key_management/shared/application/services/`
- [x] Implement 4 filtering strategies (All, ForVault, AvailableForVault, ConnectedOnly)
- [x] Move all list_* helper functions to service (4 functions, ~200 lines)
- [x] Replace all `KeyRegistry::load()` with `KeyRegistryService` calls in service
- [x] Add comprehensive logging and instrumentation
- [x] Add tests for UnifiedKeyListService
- [x] Verify: `make validate-rust` passes (619 tests)
- [x] Commit: "feat: create UnifiedKeyListService for cross-subsystem key aggregation"

- [x] Achieved: Reduced from 683 lines → 442 lines (241 lines removed, 35% reduction)
- [x] Verify: `make validate-rust` passes (619 tests)
- [x] Commit: "feat: transform unified_keys commands to use service layer"

### Milestone 4.3: Final Validation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Run `make validate-rust` - all 619 tests passing
- [x] Verified: No code duplication remains
- [x] Verified: No direct `KeyRegistry::load()` calls in unified_keys commands
- [x] Verified: All commands now use proper service layer
- [x] Final size: 442 lines (from 683 - still has conversion functions + types)
- [x] All architectural violations eliminated
- [x] Phase 4 complete - tech debt eliminated

## Phase 5: Storage Dissolution

**Goal:** Eliminate the storage "fake domain" by moving components to proper domain ownership. Storage was a technical layer masquerading as a domain - dissolve it into proper infrastructure.

**Current Storage Analysis (18 import sites across codebase):**

**Components to Migrate:**
1. `vault_store/` (7 functions) → belongs to **Vault domain**
2. `key_registry.rs` → ✅ Already moved to `key_management/infrastructure` (Phase 1)
3. `key_store/` (8 functions + metadata) → belongs to **Key Management domain**
4. `path_management/` (5 directories + validation) → **Shared Infrastructure** (keep location)
5. `cache/` (metrics + storage cache) → **Shared Infrastructure** OR services/storage
6. `metadata.rs` (VaultMetadata) → belongs to **Vault domain**
7. `errors.rs` (StorageError) → **Shared Infrastructure**

### Milestone 5.1: Move vault_store to Vault Domain
- [ ] Backup current vault_store files
- [ ] Create `services/vault/infrastructure/persistence/` directory
- [ ] Move `storage/vault_store/persistence.rs` → `vault/infrastructure/persistence/vault_persistence.rs`
- [ ] Move `storage/metadata.rs` (VaultMetadata) → `vault/infrastructure/persistence/metadata.rs`
- [ ] Update `vault_store` imports (7 files):
  - commands/key_management/unified_keys.rs
  - commands/key_management/yubikey/vault_commands.rs
  - services/crypto/application/services/vault_encryption_service.rs
  - services/key_management/passphrase/application/services/vault_integration_service.rs
  - services/key_management/shared/application/services/registry_service.rs
  - services/vault/infrastructure/vault_repository.rs
  - Plus any in commands/vault if exists
- [ ] Update vault domain mod.rs exports
- [ ] Verify: `make validate-rust` passes
- [ ] Commit: "feat: move vault_store to vault domain infrastructure"

### Milestone 5.2: Move key_store to Key Management Domain
- [ ] Create `services/key_management/shared/infrastructure/key_storage/` directory
- [ ] Move `storage/key_store/*` → `key_management/shared/infrastructure/key_storage/`
  - mod.rs, operations.rs, validation.rs, metadata.rs
- [ ] Update key_store imports (8 files):
  - services/key_management/shared/application/services/registry_service.rs (uses KeyInfo, vault_store)
  - services/key_management/passphrase/infrastructure/storage.rs
  - services/storage/application/services/key_service.rs (uses delete_key, list_keys)
  - Any commands using load_encrypted_key, save_encrypted_key
- [ ] Update key_management mod.rs exports
- [ ] Verify: `make validate-rust` passes
- [ ] Commit: "feat: move key_store to key_management infrastructure"

### Milestone 5.3: Handle Shared Infrastructure (path_management, cache, errors)
- [ ] **Option A: Keep in place** - path_management is truly shared (used by multiple domains)
- [ ] **Option B: Move to root infrastructure/** - create src-tauri/src/infrastructure/
- [ ] Decision: Assess usage patterns
- [ ] Update imports if moved
- [ ] Verify: `make validate-rust` passes
- [ ] Commit: "refactor: consolidate shared infrastructure utilities"

### Milestone 5.4: Eliminate storage Module
- [ ] Verify NO `use crate::storage::KeyRegistry` (should be key_management::shared)
- [ ] Verify NO `use crate::storage::vault_store` (should be vault::infrastructure)
- [ ] Verify NO `use crate::storage::key_store` (should be key_management::infrastructure)
- [ ] Update remaining backward compatibility re-exports to point to new locations
- [ ] Remove `pub mod storage` from src-tauri/src/lib.rs
- [ ] Delete `src-tauri/src/storage/` directory (or rename to `infrastructure/` if keeping shared utils)
- [ ] Verify: `make validate-rust` passes - all tests must pass
- [ ] Manual test: full encryption/decryption workflow
- [ ] Commit: "feat: dissolve storage fake domain into proper domain infrastructure"
