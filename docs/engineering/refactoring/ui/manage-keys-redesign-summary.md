### 2. Code Changes

#### Updated Imports
- ✅ Added `Fingerprint` icon from lucide-react
- ✅ Replaced `YubiKeyDetector` with `YubiKeySetupDialog`
- ✅ Removed `Upload` icon (no longer needed)
- ✅ Removed `KeyImportDialog` import

#### Removed Components/Functions
- ❌ Removed "Import .enc" button functionality
- ❌ Removed `handleImportKey` function
- ❌ Removed `handleKeyImport` callback (145 lines)
- ❌ Removed `handleYubiKeyAdd` function
- ❌ Removed `isImporting` state
- ❌ Removed `KeyImportDialog` component rendering

#### Added/Modified Components
- ✅ Added card-based "Create New Key" section with dashed border
- ✅ Passphrase card with Key icon (blue hover state)
- ✅ YubiKey card with Fingerprint icon (purple hover state)
- ✅ Replaced YubiKeyDetector with YubiKeySetupDialog
- ✅ Simplified action bar to right-aligned only

### 3. Visual Consistency
- ✅ Matches Vault Hub's card-based pattern
- ✅ Uses consistent hover effects (border color + background)
- ✅ Maintains visual hierarchy with centered title
- ✅ Cards have descriptive subtitles
- ✅ Icons are larger (h-12 w-12) for better visual impact

### 4. File Metrics
- **Original backup:** `/docs/engineering/refactoring/ui/backups/ManageKeysPage.tsx.bak`
- **Final line count:** 332 lines
- **Note:** File exceeds 200 LOC guideline due to necessary business logic handlers (handleAttachKey, handleDeleteKey, handleExportKey)

### 5. Testing Checklist
- [x] Passphrase card opens PassphraseKeyDialog
- [x] YubiKey card opens YubiKeySetupDialog
- [x] Filter dropdown remains functional
- [x] Grid/List view toggle works
- [x] Refresh button works
- [x] Visual consistency with Vault Hub achieved

### 6. Refactoring Guidelines Compliance
- ✅ Created backup before making changes
- ✅ Used existing handlers where possible
- ✅ Maintained cache-first architecture
- ✅ Removed unused imports and state
- ✅ Formatted with Prettier
- ⚠️ File exceeds 200 LOC target (332 lines) but contains necessary business logic

## Notes
- Import functionality was completely removed as it's not part of the new design
- YubiKeySetupDialog now handles YubiKey setup internally (no need for handleYubiKeyAdd)
- The file could be further refactored by extracting handlers to a custom hook if stricter LOC limits are required
