# File 2: YubiKey Services mod.rs Refactoring Summary

## Completed: ✅

### Original File
- **Path:** `src-tauri/src/services/key_management/yubikey/application/services/mod.rs`
- **Lines:** 734 LOC
- **Backup:** `docs/engineering/refactoring/backups/phase1-critical/yubikey_services_mod.rs`

### Refactoring Results

Successfully split the monolithic `mod.rs` into organized modules:

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `mod.rs` | 47 | Module declarations and re-exports only |
| `factory.rs` | 183 | ServiceFactory struct and implementation |
| `traits.rs` | 46 | Service and SerialScoped traits |
| `metrics.rs` | 54 | ServiceMetrics, ServiceHealth, OperationContext |
| `tests.rs` | 423 | All test code (mock services and tests) |

### Existing Service Files (unchanged)
- `device_service.rs`: 435 LOC
- `file_service.rs`: 463 LOC
- `identity_service.rs`: 619 LOC (noted for future refactoring)
- `registry_service.rs`: 656 LOC (noted for future refactoring)

### Key Achievements
1. ✅ All new files under 300 LOC (except tests.rs which has looser requirements)
2. ✅ Clean separation of concerns
3. ✅ All 387 tests passing
4. ✅ No logic changes - pure restructuring
5. ✅ Validation successful: `make validate-rust` passes

### Architecture Benefits
- **Factory Pattern:** Isolated in dedicated file for service creation
- **Traits:** Centralized trait definitions for consistent service behavior
- **Metrics:** Dedicated module for monitoring and observability types
- **Tests:** Separated from production code while maintaining coverage

### Notes
- Two service files exceed 600 LOC limit but were pre-existing:
  - `identity_service.rs` (619 LOC)
  - `registry_service.rs` (656 LOC)
- These can be addressed in Phase 2 refactoring if needed

### Validation
```bash
make validate-rust  # ✅ All checks pass
# - Formatting: ✅
# - Clippy: ✅
# - Tests: ✅ 387 tests passing
```
