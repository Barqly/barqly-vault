Manager: Prep for R2

I am preparing for R2 release. one question came up is how to handle the plugin binaries (age 1.2.0, age-plugin 0.5.0, ykman 5.8.0)
- I am thinking we should go with prebuilt binaraies (this is what we did during our development on mac and can do the same for win/linux)
- where to store: src-tauri/bin and check it in github, this is quicker. I have the github $4 per month plan, i don't know if that provides any better option to store the binaries?.

Great question. Short answer: don’t check big binaries into your source repo. Use prebuilt binaries, yes—but fetch them into the app at build time and ship them inside your installers. Here’s a clean, repeatable pattern that’s worked well for Tauri apps:

# What to do

1. Use prebuilt, pinned binaries

* age v1.2.0, age-plugin-yubikey v0.5.0, ykman v5.8.0.
* Pin exact URLs and SHA256 hashes per OS/arch (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64 (musl/glibc as needed), win-x64).
* Verify checksums in CI before packaging.

2. Store binaries as GitHub Release assets (not in `git`)

* Create a separate repo like `barqly-vault-binaries` (or use the existing app repo) and publish a Release `tools-r2` with assets named, e.g.:

  * `age-1.2.0-darwin-arm64`
  * `age-plugin-yubikey-0.5.0-windows-x86_64.exe`
  * `ykman-5.8.0-linux-x86_64`
* Why Releases? They’re fast, versioned, and don’t count against your git history. Your $4 GitHub plan doesn’t meaningfully change this—Releases are already the right place. Git LFS works but adds quota/bandwidth management overhead and still clutters the repo.

3. Fetch into `src-tauri/bin/` during CI/build

* Add `scripts/fetch-tools.{sh,ps1}` that:

  * Detects OS/arch
  * Downloads the right asset from the Release
  * Verifies SHA256
  * `chmod +x`
  * Writes to `src-tauri/bin/` (or `src-tauri/resources/bin/…`)
* Keep `src-tauri/bin/` **out** of git via `.gitignore`. They exist only in build artifacts and packaged apps.

4. Bundle as Tauri sidecars

* In `tauri.conf.json`:

  * Use `bundle > resources` or `tauri > bundle > externalBin` (sidecars) to include those executables.
  * Prefer sidecars so you can invoke them with Tauri’s shell API by logical name.
* macOS: every sidecar must be codesigned and end up notarized within the app bundle. Make sure your build step runs code signing on the fetched binaries (Tauri’s bundler will sign sidecars if they’re declared).
* Windows: include in MSI/NSIS; code-sign if you have a cert.
* Linux: include in AppImage or deb/rpm. Prefer static builds (musl) when possible to avoid glibc headaches.

5. Runtime strategy per OS

* macOS & Windows: always ship the sidecars; don’t rely on system installs.
* Linux: if shipping AppImage, include them. If distributing a plain tarball, still include them; don’t make users chase packages.

6. Security & supply-chain hygiene

* Verify upstream signatures/hashes (e.g., age release SHAs).
* Pin versions in a `tools.lock` file (OS/arch → URL + SHA256).
* Validate at build time; fail fast if mismatch.
* Do not execute anything from `$PATH`; always point to your bundled sidecar paths.
* Include upstream LICENSE files inside your installer (e.g., `licenses/`).

7. Dev ergonomics

* Local dev can use a cached `~/.cache/barqly/tools/…` to avoid re-download.
* `make tools` (or `pnpm tools`) populates `src-tauri/bin/` before `tauri build`.
* CI (GitHub Actions) runs the same scripts; cache by URL+SHA key.

# Minimal file layout

```
/scripts/
  fetch-tools.sh
  fetch-tools.ps1
/tools.lock            # JSON/YAML: per-platform URL + sha256
/src-tauri/
  bin/                 # .gitignore’d; populated at build
  tauri.conf.json      # sidecar config (externalBin/resources)
```

`.gitignore`:

```
/src-tauri/bin/*
!/src-tauri/bin/.keep   # optional
```

# Sample `tools.lock` (idea)

```json
{
  "darwin-arm64": {
    "age": {
      "url": "https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/releases/download/v1.2.0/age-darwin-arm64",
      "sha256": "<…>"
    },
    "age-plugin-yubikey": {
      "url": "https://github.com/str4d/age-plugin-yubikey/releases/download/v0.5.0/age-plugin-yubikey-darwin-arm64",
      "sha256": "<…>"
    },
    "ykman": {
      "url": "https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/Releases/ykman-5.8.0-macos-universal",
      "sha256": "<…>"
    }
  },
  "windows-x64": { … },
  "linux-x64": { … }
}
```

# Tauri config tips

* In `tauri.conf.json`:

  * If using sidecars:

    ```json
    {
      "tauri": {
        "bundle": {
          "externalBin": [
            "src-tauri/bin/age",
            "src-tauri/bin/age-plugin-yubikey",
            "src-tauri/bin/ykman"
          ]
        },
        "allowlist": { "shell": { "all": false, "sidecar": true } }
      }
    }
    ```
  * Invoke with `Command.sidecar("age")…` from Rust/JS.

* macOS codesign/notarize: ensure the sidecars are inside the app bundle and get signed by Tauri’s bundler. If you sign manually, sign *before* bundling or re-sign the bundle after injection (prefer letting Tauri handle it).

# About GitHub $4 plan

* It doesn’t give you a fundamentally “better place” to store large binaries for distribution. The best option remains **GitHub Releases assets** (free for public repos, and fine for private).
* Avoid committing binaries; avoid LFS unless you truly need repo-local versioning of blobs. Releases are simpler and scale better for installers.

# Practical next steps (fast)

1. Create a `tools.lock` with URLs+SHA256 for the three tools per platform.
2. Add `scripts/fetch-tools.sh` to populate `src-tauri/bin/` (and set +x).
3. Wire `prebuild` step in your workflow: `./scripts/fetch-tools.sh && pnpm tauri build`.
4. Update `tauri.conf.json` to include sidecars.
5. Include upstream LICENSE files in the installer’s `resources/licenses/`.

If you want, I can draft the exact `fetch-tools.sh` and a Tauri config snippet tailored to your current repo structure.

Manager: I am not familiar with Github Release...give me step by step how to do it

Got you. Here’s a clean, step-by-step for using **GitHub Releases** to host your prebuilt binaries (and keep them out of git). I’ll show both the **web UI** and the **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** ways.

# Option A — Web UI (manual, fastest once)

1. **Open Releases**
   Go to your repo → right side → **Releases** → **Draft a new release**. ([GitHub Docs][1])

2. **Choose a tag and title**

* Tag version: e.g. `tools-r2` (or `age-1.2.0_age-yubikey-0.5.0_ykman-5.8.0`).
* If the tag doesn’t exist yet, GitHub will create it for you here.
* Give the release a name (e.g. “Barqly Vault Tools R2”).

3. **Mark as Pre-release (optional)**
   If you don’t want this to show as “Latest release” for the app, tick **Pre-release**. You can always promote later. ([GitHub Docs][1])

4. **Upload assets**
   Drag your binaries into the “Attach binaries by dropping them here” area. That’s where your `age`, `age-plugin-yubikey`, and `ykman` files go (one per OS/arch, with good names like `age-1.2.0-darwin-arm64`). ([GitHub Docs][1])

5. **Publish**
   Click **Publish release**. You now get stable, versioned asset URLs you can download during builds. (Releases are designed specifically for packaging binaries; quota/bandwidth is handled by GitHub.) ([GitHub Docs][2])

# Option B — GitHub CLI (scriptable, great for CI)

> First: install `gh` and authenticate (`gh auth login`). ([GitHub CLI][3])

1. **Create the release with assets in one go**

```bash
# from the repo root
gh release create tools-r2 \
  ./dist/age-1.2.0-darwin-arm64 \
  ./dist/age-plugin-yubikey-0.5.0-darwin-arm64 \
  ./dist/ykman-5.8.0-macos-universal \
  --title "Barqly Vault Tools R2" \
  --notes "Pinned toolset for R2 (age 1.2.0, age-plugin-yubikey 0.5.0, ykman 5.8.0)" \
  --prerelease
```

This creates tag `tools-r2` if it doesn’t exist and uploads the listed files as assets. ([GitHub CLI][4])

2. **(Or) upload assets later / separately**

```bash
gh release upload tools-r2 ./dist/age-1.2.0-linux-x86_64 --clobber
```

`--clobber` overwrites an asset with the same name. ([GitHub CLI][5])

3. **Download from a release in scripts**

```bash
# Grab the right asset for the current OS/arch
gh release download tools-r2 --pattern "age-*-darwin-arm64" --dir ./src-tauri/bin
```

You can match by `--pattern` per platform during CI. ([GitHub CLI][6])

# How you’ll wire this into R2

* Create **one dedicated release** (e.g., `tools-r2`) that holds all three tools for all target platforms.
* In your build script, select the right filename by OS/arch pattern, **download**, verify **SHA256**, `chmod +x`, then bundle as Tauri sidecars.
* Keep your binaries **out of git**; only your release assets carry them.

# Tips & gotchas

* **File names**: avoid weird characters; GitHub may rename assets with special characters—stick to simple, alphanumeric + dashes/underscores. ([GitHub Docs][7])
* **API/automation**: if you ever need raw API scripting (curl), the Releases + Release Assets REST endpoints are documented here. ([GitHub Docs][8])
* **Actions alternative**: there are marketplace actions that upload files to an existing release if you prefer pure YAML. ([GitHub][9])

If you want, say the word and I’ll draft a tiny `scripts/publish-tools.sh` (makes the release + uploads assets) and a matching `scripts/fetch-tools.sh` (downloads the right asset at build).
