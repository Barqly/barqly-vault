# Frontend Test Refactoring Action Plan

*Created: 2025-08-09*

## Overview

This action plan provides specific, prioritized tasks for refactoring the frontend test suite to eliminate implementation detail testing and focus on user behavior validation.

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Production components contain 50+ `data-testid` attributes across 13 files, polluting production code with test-specific attributes. This requires source code cleanup before test refactoring.

## Priority 0: Source Code Cleanup (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

### Problem Analysis
- **50 `data-testid` attributes** polluting production HTML across 13 components
- **Components already have proper semantic structure**: labels, aria attributes, roles
- **Zero production value** - these attributes only exist for testing
- **Bundle size impact** - unnecessary attributes shipped to users

### Target Components for Cleanup
- PassphraseField.tsx (5 instances)
- EnhancedInput.tsx (7 instances)
- PrimaryButton.tsx (5 instances)
- FormSection.tsx (5 instances)
- CollapsibleHelp.tsx (4 instances)
- ProgressContext.tsx (4 instances)
- success-message.tsx (3 instances)
- Plus 6 additional components

### Semantic Replacement Strategy
- Remove all data-testid attributes from production components
- Validate existing semantic alternatives (id, aria-label, text content)
- Keep existing proper accessibility attributes

### Validation Before Cleanup
- [ ] Confirm all inputs have proper `id` attributes for `getByLabelText`
- [ ] Confirm all buttons have text content or `aria-label` for `getByRole`
- [ ] Confirm all interactive elements have semantic identifiers
- [ ] Document any legitimate cases where `data-testid` might be needed

## Priority 1: Test Suite Migration (After Source Cleanup)

### Prerequisite: Priority 0 Must Be Complete

### Target Files
- `src/__tests__/components/forms/PassphraseField.test.tsx` 
- `src/__tests__/components/forms/KeyGenerationForm.test.tsx`
- `src/__tests__/components/ui/PrimaryButton.test.tsx`
- `src/__tests__/pages/EncryptPage.test.tsx`
- All files using `getByTestId()` or `data-testid` attributes

### Specific Changes Required

#### PassphraseField.test.tsx
- Remove CSS class testing
- Replace getByTestId with getByLabelText
- Focus tests on user interactions vs component structure
- Enhance accessibility attribute testing

#### PrimaryButton.test.tsx  
- Remove size class testing
- Replace getByTestId('primary-button') with getByRole('button')
- Focus on button behavior vs styling
- Keep functional state testing (disabled, loading, etc.)

## Priority 2: CSS Class Testing Removal

### Target Files
- `src/__tests__/components/forms/PassphraseField.test.tsx`
- `src/__tests__/components/ui/PrimaryButton.test.tsx`
- `src/__tests__/pages/EncryptPage.test.tsx`
- Any other files with `.toHaveClass()` assertions

### Elimination Strategy

#### Replace data-testid with Semantic Queries
- Replace data-testid queries with semantic alternatives (getByRole, getByLabelText, etc)
- Focus on how users identify elements rather than implementation details
- Remove generic field presence tests

#### Component Interaction Focus
- Replace component structure tests with user interaction validation tests
- Test user workflows rather than component existence
- Focus on behavior rather than implementation

### Keep data-testid Only When Necessary

**Acceptable use cases:**
- Complex components without clear semantic alternatives
- Components with multiple similar elements  
- Temporary identification during development

**Document remaining usage:**

## Priority 3: Component Presence Test Cleanup

### Target Files
- `src/__tests__/pages/EncryptPage.test.tsx`
- `src/__tests__/pages/DecryptPage.test.tsx`
- `src/__tests__/pages/SetupPage.test.tsx`

### Changes Required

#### Remove Pure Presence Tests
- Remove tests that only check if components are rendered
- Remove step indicator presence checking
- Focus on user interaction outcomes

#### Focus on User Workflow Tests
- Enhance end-to-end workflow testing
- Test complete user journeys from start to finish
- Validate user-visible outcomes at each step
- Focus on interaction flows rather than component existence

## Priority 4: Tauri API Mocking Consistency (Missing from Original Assessment)

### Target Files
- `src/__tests__/hooks/useFileEncryption/` - Inconsistent mocking patterns
- `src/__tests__/hooks/useFileDecryption/` - Some tests don't mock safeInvoke properly  
- `src/__tests__/pages/` - Page tests need Tauri environment mocking

### Critical Tasks for A+ Grade
- Standardize Tauri API mocking patterns across all tests
- Ensure consistent safeInvoke/safeListen mocking
- Add environment-specific test coverage for desktop vs web
- Test both success and failure scenarios for Tauri API calls

## Priority 5: Test Assertion Quality Improvements (Missing)

### Target: Upgrade Generic Assertions
- Replace weak generic assertions with specific validations
- Add detailed object matching for complex state
- Provide actionable failure messages
- Test specific array lengths and object properties

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Source Code Cleanup (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Remove all `data-testid` attributes from production components
- [ ] Validate semantic alternatives exist (id, aria-label, text content)
- [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces to remove testid props if any
- [ ] Test components render correctly without test attributes

### Week 2: Test Suite Migration (Critical Priority)
- [ ] Audit all `getByTestId()` usage across test files  
- [ ] Replace with `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByText` where possible
- [ ] Document remaining `data-testid` usage with justification
- [ ] Update component tests to focus on user interactions

### Week 2: CSS Class Testing Removal
- [ ] Audit all `.toHaveClass()` usage across test files
- [ ] Replace with user-perceivable state testing (messages, aria attributes)
- [ ] Remove purely visual styling tests
- [ ] Focus on functional state validation

### Week 3: Tauri API Mocking Standardization
- [ ] Standardize `safeInvoke`/`safeListen` mocking across all hook tests
- [ ] Add environment-specific test coverage (desktop vs web)
- [ ] Ensure error scenarios properly test Tauri API failures
- [ ] Add missing Tauri integration tests in page components

### Week 4: Component Presence Cleanup & Test Quality
- [ ] Remove pure component presence tests
- [ ] Enhance workflow-based integration tests  
- [ ] Upgrade generic assertions to specific validations
- [ ] Consolidate similar tests into comprehensive user journeys
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Update test documentation
- [ ] Create examples of good vs. bad test patterns
- [ ] Team review of refactored tests

## File-by-File Refactoring Checklist

- [ ] Replace `getByTestId` with `getByLabelText` (lines 19-21, 27-28, etc.)
- [ ] Focus tests on user interactions vs. component structure
- [ ] Enhance accessibility attribute testing

### PrimaryButton.test.tsx  
- [ ] Remove size class testing (lines 74-83)
- [ ] Replace `getByTestId('primary-button')` with `getByRole('button')`
- [ ] Focus on button behavior vs. styling
- [ ] Keep functional state testing (disabled, loading, etc.)

### EncryptPage.test.tsx

- [ ] Replace `getByTestId` for form elements
- [ ] Enhance integration test scenarios

## Quality Gates for A+ Grade

### Before Merging Refactored Tests
- [ ] All tests pass with existing functionality
- [ ] **95%+ of queries use semantic alternatives** to `data-testid` (increased from 90%)
- [ ] **Zero CSS class assertions** remain (except justified visual tests)
- [ ] **Consistent Tauri API mocking** across all test files
- [ ] **Specific assertions** instead of generic null/boolean checks
- [ ] All component presence tests replaced with interaction tests
- [ ] User workflows comprehensively covered
- [ ] **Both desktop and web environments tested** for critical flows
- [ ] Error scenarios properly test Tauri API failures

### Success Metrics for A+ Grade
- [ ] **90% reduction in test-breaking UI changes** (semantic queries resist UI refactors)
- [ ] **Zero maintenance overhead from CSS class changes** 
- [ ] **Standardized Tauri mocking** eliminates environment test failures
- [ ] **Specific assertion failures** provide actionable debugging info
- [ ] **Faster test suite execution** from removing redundant presence tests
