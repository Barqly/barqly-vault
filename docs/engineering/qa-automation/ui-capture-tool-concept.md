# UI Capture & Analysis Tool - Concept Document

## Overview

A flexible, automated desktop application screenshot capture and AI analysis tool for design consistency auditing. This tool enables both manual and automated workflows for capturing UI screenshots and generating actionable design improvement recommendations.

## Problem Statement

**Current Challenge:**

- Manual screenshot capture for UI consistency review is time-consuming
- Copy-paste workflow for sharing screenshots with agents is inefficient
- No systematic approach to tracking design consistency across evolving UI screens
- Need for automated design analysis without manual intervention

**Business Value:**

- Reduce manual effort in UI consistency reviews
- Enable systematic design quality tracking as the application evolves
- Provide actionable, AI-powered design recommendations
- Support both ad-hoc and automated design audits

## Tool Philosophy

### Flexibility First

- **Screen Agnostic**: Tool shouldn't hardcode specific screens or navigation paths
- **Evolution Ready**: Handle new screens, renamed screens, and removed screens without tool changes
- **Selective Capture**: Ability to capture specific screens or all screens as needed
- **Manual & Automated**: Support both interactive and automated workflows

### Technology Approach

- **Desktop Screen Capture**: Universal approach that works with any desktop application
- **AI Integration**: Automated analysis using Claude Code agents
- **Structured Output**: Organized file structure with metadata and analysis

├── sessions/
│   └── 2025-01-09_143022/          # Timestamp-based session
│       ├── screenshots/
│       │   ├── setup-screen.png
│       │   ├── encrypt-screen.png
│       │   └── decrypt-screen.png
│       ├── metadata/
│       │   ├── session-manifest.json
│       │   └── capture-log.txt
│       └── analysis/
│           ├── ai-analysis-prompt.md
│           └── analysis-results.md
├── latest/                         # Symlink to most recent session
└── templates/
    └── analysis-prompts/
```

### 3. AI Analysis Integration

- **Automated Prompt Generation**: Context-aware analysis requests
- **Claude Code Agent Integration**: Direct task system integration
- **Structured Analysis Output**: Consistent, actionable recommendations
- **Historical Comparison**: Track improvements over time

### 4. Developer Workflow Integration

- **NPM Script Integration**: `npm run ui:capture`
- **Makefile Integration**: `make ui-capture`
- **CI/CD Ready**: Potential future integration for automated design audits
- **Documentation Generation**: Auto-update design consistency documentation

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Ad-Hoc Design Review

**Scenario**: Developer notices inconsistency, wants quick analysis
**Flow**:

1. Run `npm run ui:capture`
2. Navigate through relevant screens when prompted
3. Tool captures screenshots and generates AI analysis
4. Review recommendations and implement changes

### Use Case 2: Pre-Release Design Audit

**Scenario**: Before major release, ensure design consistency
**Flow**:

1. Run comprehensive capture of all screens
2. Generate detailed analysis comparing against design system
3. Prioritize improvements based on AI recommendations
4. Track completion of design consistency tasks

### Use Case 3: Design Evolution Tracking

**Scenario**: Monitor design consistency over time
**Flow**:

1. Regular captures during development cycles
2. Historical comparison of design improvements
3. Trend analysis of consistency metrics
4. Design debt tracking and resolution

### Use Case 4: New Team Member Onboarding

**Scenario**: Help new developers understand current design state
**Flow**:

1. Generate current state capture with analysis
2. Use as baseline for understanding design patterns
3. Reference during code reviews and design discussions
