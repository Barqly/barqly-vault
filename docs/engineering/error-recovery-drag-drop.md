# Error Recovery and User Feedback Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive error recovery and user-visible feedback for the drag-and-drop functionality in Barqly Vault, addressing the architect's recommendations for robust error handling.

## Implementation Date
2025-08-05

## Components Created

### 1. Toast Notification System
- **Files Created:**
  - `/src-ui/src/components/ui/Toast.tsx` - Toast component with multiple types (success, error, warning, info)
  - `/src-ui/src/components/ui/ToastContainer.tsx` - Container for managing multiple toasts
  - `/src-ui/src/hooks/useToast.ts` - Hook for managing toast state and operations

### 2. Error Recovery Component
- **File Created:**
  - `/src-ui/src/components/ui/ErrorRecovery.tsx` - Comprehensive error recovery UI with suggested steps

### 3. Retry Utility
- **File Created:**
  - `/src-ui/src/utils/retry.ts` - Exponential backoff retry logic with configurable options

## Components Modified

### 1. FileDropZone Component
**File:** `/src-ui/src/components/encrypt/FileDropZone.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `onError` prop to interface for error callback
- Implemented fallback detection when backend fails:
  - Single path → assumes folder
  - Multiple paths → assumes files
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for backend calls
- Enhanced error messages with user-friendly text
- Integrated error callbacks for all failure points

### 2. EncryptPage Component
**File:** `/src-ui/src/pages/EncryptPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Integrated toast notification system
- Added `handleDropZoneError` callback for FileDropZone errors
- Implemented retry counter for transient errors
- Added success notifications for file selection and encryption
- Added error notifications with retry options
- Enhanced user feedback throughout the encryption process

## Error Recovery Features

### 1. Fallback Mechanisms
- **Backend Failure:** When `get_file_info` fails, uses heuristic detection:
  - Single dropped path → assumes folder
  - Multiple dropped paths → assumes files
- **Graceful Degradation:** Application remains functional even when backend is unavailable

### 2. Retry Logic
- **Automatic Retry:** Backend calls retry up to 2 times with 500ms initial delay
- **Exponential Backoff:** Prevents overwhelming the system during failures
- **User-Initiated Retry:** Toast notifications include retry buttons for manual recovery

### 3. User Feedback
- **Toast Notifications:** Non-intrusive feedback for all operations
- **Error Recovery UI:** Detailed error information with suggested recovery steps
- **Progress Indication:** Clear feedback during long-running operations
- **Success Confirmation:** Positive feedback when operations complete

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test suite: `FileDropZone.error-recovery.test.tsx`
- Tests cover:
  - Backend failure scenarios
  - Fallback detection logic
  - Browse button error handling
  - Retry mechanisms
  - Error callback invocations

### Test Results
- All 565 tests pass
- 6 new error recovery tests added
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Architecture Compliance

### Addressed Architect's Recommendations:
1. ✅ **Added error props to FileDropZone**
2. ✅ **Implemented fallback mechanisms**
3. ✅ **Surface errors to users** (toast notifications)
4. ✅ **No more silent failures**
5. ✅ **Clear user feedback when drops fail**
6. ✅ **Graceful degradation when backend unavailable**
7. ✅ **Retry options for users**

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Silent failures with console-only logging
- Users unaware of errors
- No recovery options
- Application could appear frozen

### After:
- Visible error notifications with context
- Suggested recovery steps
- Retry options for transient failures
- Application remains responsive during errors

## Code Quality

### Best Practices Implemented:
- **Error Boundaries:** Proper error catching at all levels
- **User-Friendly Messages:** Technical errors translated to user language
- **Logging Preserved:** Console logging maintained for debugging
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript typing for all new components
- **Testability:** Comprehensive test coverage for error scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. Add telemetry for error tracking
2. Implement offline queue for failed operations
3. Add progressive retry with different strategies
4. Create error reporting mechanism for support
5. Add user preferences for notification behavior

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses all architect recommendations while maintaining code quality and user experience standards. The application now provides robust error recovery with clear user feedback, ensuring no silent failures and offering multiple recovery paths for users.
