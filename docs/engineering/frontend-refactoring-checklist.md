- [ ] Bundle size remains under 5MB target

## Notes for AI Agents

When refactoring frontend code:
1. **Check component size BEFORE adding new features**
2. **Plan extraction if approaching 100 lines for components**
3. **NEVER allow components over 150 lines**
4. **Extract custom hooks for complex logic**
5. **Create sub-components for repeated UI patterns**
6. **Preserve all functionality and tests**
7. **Update imports in dependent files**
8. **Run `make validate-ui` after each refactoring**
9. **Consider React best practices (hooks, composition, single responsibility)**
10. **Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout**

## Refactoring Patterns

### Component Refactoring Pattern
```typescript
// Before: Monolithic component (300+ lines)
const LargeComponent = () => {
  // All logic here
}

// After: Composition pattern
const useComponentLogic = () => { /* Extract hook */ }
const ComponentHeader = () => { /* Sub-component */ }
const ComponentBody = () => { /* Sub-component */ }
const ComponentFooter = () => { /* Sub-component */ }

const RefactoredComponent = () => {
  const logic = useComponentLogic();
  return (
    <>
      <ComponentHeader {...logic} />
      <ComponentBody {...logic} />
      <ComponentFooter {...logic} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Tracking

This checklist will be updated as refactoring progresses. Mark items complete as they are finished and update line counts after each refactoring.

*Total files needing refactoring: 12+ source files, 17+ test files*  
*Estimated effort: 4-5 days of focused refactoring*  
*Priority: Focus on page components first as they impact user experience most directly*
