# Drag and Drop Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The drag and drop functionality was failing because:
1. The `FileDropZone` component was listening for Tauri file-drop events and receiving file paths
2. However, the `useFileEncryption` hook's `selectFiles` method was NOT calling any backend command
3. It was just creating a placeholder `FileSelection` object with fake file sizes
4. This caused the file selection to fail silently in the desktop app

## Solution Implemented

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated `useFileEncryption` hook (`src-ui/src/hooks/useFileEncryption.ts`)
- Modified `selectFiles` method to call the backend `get_file_info` command
- Now properly retrieves actual file metadata from the backend
- Calculates real file sizes and counts instead of using placeholders
- Added proper error handling for file info retrieval

#### 2. Enhanced `FileDropZone` component (`src-ui/src/components/encrypt/FileDropZone.tsx`)
- Added try-catch error handling around `onFilesSelected` call
- Added console logging for debugging drag and drop events
- Properly awaits the async file selection process

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced `get_file_info` command (`src-tauri/src/commands/file_commands.rs`)
- Modified to calculate recursive directory sizes
- Added `file_count` field to `FileInfo` struct for directories
- Now properly counts all files within directories
- Calculates total size of all files in a directory recursively

## How It Works Now

1. User drags files/folders onto the FileDropZone
2. Tauri emits a `tauri://file-drop` event with file paths
3. FileDropZone receives the paths and calls `onFilesSelected`
4. `useFileEncryption.selectFiles` is called with the paths
5. Backend `get_file_info` command is invoked to get actual file metadata
6. Backend returns real file sizes, names, and counts
7. Frontend updates the UI with accurate file information

## Testing Instructions

### Desktop App Testing:
1. Open the Barqly Vault desktop app
2. Navigate to the Encrypt page
3. Drag and drop files or folders onto the drop zone
4. Files should be properly detected and displayed with correct sizes

### Test File:
- A test file was created during debugging but has been removed after successful testing

### Debug Commands:
You can test the backend command directly in the browser console:
```javascript
const { invoke } = await import('@tauri-apps/api/core');
const result = await invoke('get_file_info', { paths: ['/path/to/file'] });
console.log(result);
```

## What Was NOT Changed
- The Tauri file-drop event listener remains the same
- The visual feedback for drag and drop (color changes) was already working
- The file dialog selection (Browse Files/Browse Folder buttons) was already working

## Next Steps for User Testing
1. Test with single files
2. Test with multiple files
3. Test with folders containing multiple files
4. Test with nested folder structures
5. Verify file counts and sizes are accurate
6. Check console for any errors during drag and drop

## Console Debugging
Open the developer console in the desktop app to see debug logs:
- Look for `[FileDropZone]` logs when dragging and dropping
- Look for `[useFileEncryption]` logs for file selection
- Look for `TauriSafe` logs for backend command execution
