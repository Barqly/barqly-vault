You’re super close. Personally, I’d **standardize the content width across all three screens** so the UI doesn’t “breathe” differently as users switch tabs. The current Setup width is a bit narrower than Encrypt/Decrypt; it’s not wrong, but the tiny mismatch is noticeable once you see it.

If you want the cleanest, most predictable feel, do this:

---

## @sr-frontend-engineer — unify content width

### 1) One content width for all screens

Use a single max-width token and center it on **Setup, Encrypt, Decrypt**.

**Token**

```css
:root { --content-max-w: 980px; } /* pick one value and stick to it */
```

**Tailwind (preferred)**

```html
<!-- page content wrapper under the header/stepper -->
<div class="mx-auto w-full max-w-[var(--content-max-w)] px-6 md:px-8">
  <!-- page-specific cards go here -->
</div>
```

> 980px feels right based on your screenshots: wide enough for the dropzone and to keep the public key on one line, but not so wide that forms get “stretchy.”
> If you’d rather use Tailwind presets, `max-w-5xl` (1024px) is a safe alternative—just use it **everywhere**.

### 2) Cards fill the content width

Inside that wrapper, cards should use `w-full` with their usual style:

```html
<div class="w-full rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white shadow-sm">
  …
</div>
```

### 3) Public key line behavior (Setup success)

Keep it **single-line** with graceful overflow (so it never wraps weirdly on smaller screens):

```html
<div class="bg-slate-100 rounded-lg px-3 py-2 font-mono text-sm text-slate-800
            whitespace-nowrap overflow-x-auto scrollbar-none">
  age1eschmv3hfmeyw4wcl8j4dy…
</div>
```

(If you prefer no scrollbars, keep the current wrapping but you now have width parity so it’ll generally stay on one line.)

### 4) Spacing quick pass

Ensure vertical rhythm matches Encrypt/Decrypt:

* Header → content wrapper top margin: `mt-6 md:mt-8`
* Card internal padding: `p-5 md:p-6`
* Between card sections (title, field groups, footnotes): `space-y-4 md:space-y-5`

### 5) QA checklist

* [ ] Setup, Encrypt, Decrypt all use the **same** `max-w-[var(--content-max-w)]`.
* [ ] The dropzone, forms, and success cards **align** edge-to-edge with each other when switching tabs.
* [ ] The Setup success public key shows **on one line** at typical desktop widths; on narrower screens it scrolls horizontally rather than wrapping.
* [ ] No layout shift in the stepper/heading when navigating screens.

### TL;DR

Your current Setup looks good, but I recommend matching its content width to Encrypt/Decrypt (e.g., **980px**) for a more seamless feel. It will also keep the public key tidy without special-casing to maintain symmetry.
