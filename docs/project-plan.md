# Barqly Vault Project Plan

## Project Overview

Barqly Vault is a cross-platform desktop application for secure file encryption using the `age` encryption standard, built with Tauri and Rust.

## Development Principles

- **Security First**: All cryptographic operations must be audited and follow best practices
- **User Experience**: Simple, intuitive interface hiding complexity
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior across macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Testability**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Clear code documentation and user guides
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Tauri + React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Rust
- **Encryption**: age (via Rust crate or CLI)
- **Archive**: tar + flate2 (GZIP compression)
- **File Operations**: walkdir (directory traversal), sha2 (hashing)
- **Build System**: Cargo + Tauri CLI
- **Testing**: Jest (frontend), Rust built-in tests (backend)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Design Decisions & Clarifications

### Key Management UX

- **Dropdown Display**: Show only key labels in the dropdown for clean UX
- **Key Selection Feedback**: Display full public key below dropdown when a key is selected
- **Future Enhancement**: Add QR code display in the right panel for easy key sharing

### Manifest File Strategy

- **Dual Storage**: Manifest stored both inside encrypted bundle AND optionally outside
- **Purpose**: Contains metadata and content hashes for pre-decryption integrity verification
- **Future Enhancement**: Add digital signatures for tamper detection

### Error Handling Approach

- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages for common scenarios:
  - "Wrong key selected - please choose the correct encryption key"
  - "File appears corrupted - integrity check failed"
  - "Passphrase incorrect - please try again"
- **Recovery Guidance**: Provide next steps for each error type

### File Selection UX Design

- **Dual Mode Selection**:
  - **Folder Mode**: User selects entire folder for encryption (no individual files allowed)
  - **File Mode**: User selects individual files (no folders allowed)
- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Available in both modes
- **Bitcoin Custody Focus**: Optimized for output descriptors, wallet databases, access keys
- **Consistency**: Maintains folder structure across platforms for reliable restoration

### Progress Indication

- **Lightweight Progress**: Simple progress bar for encryption/decryption operations
- **Size Constraints**: Optimized for Bitcoin custody files (typically <100MB total)
- **Use Case**: Primarily for wallet restoration scenarios, not bulk file storage
