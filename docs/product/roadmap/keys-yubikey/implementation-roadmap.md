## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk                        | Mitigation                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Plugin compatibility issues | Extensive testing, fallback to passphrase |
| YubiKey driver problems     | Bundle drivers, clear installation guide  |
| Performance degradation     | Benchmark, optimize, cache operations     |
| Migration failures          | Automatic backups, rollback capability    |

### User Experience Risks

| Risk                        | Mitigation                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Complexity overwhelms users | Progressive disclosure, sensible defaults |
| Lost YubiKey panic          | Clear recovery paths, enforce backups     |
| PIN forgotten               | Passphrase fallback, clear messaging      |
| Setup abandonment           | Streamlined flow, skip options            |

### Security Risks

| Risk                          | Mitigation                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Weak PINs                     | Enforce minimum requirements     |
| Single YubiKey dependency     | Strongly encourage multiple keys |
| Metadata exposure             | Encrypt sensitive metadata       |
| Supply chain attack on plugin | Verify signatures, audit code    |

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team

- 2 Backend Engineers (6 weeks)
- 2 Frontend Engineers (5 weeks)

- USB permission handling on macOS

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Rejected: Custom PIV Implementation

- Would delay release by months

### Rejected: YubiKey-Only Mode Default

- Too risky for average users
- Could lead to data loss
- Passphrase backup essential

### Future: Additional Hardware Keys

- Nitrokey support
- OnlyKey integration
- Ledger hardware wallet
- Generic FIDO2 keys

## Dependencies

### External
