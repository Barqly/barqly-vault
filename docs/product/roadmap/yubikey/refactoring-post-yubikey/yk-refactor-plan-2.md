# YubiKey Cleanup & Consolidation Plan

## Milestone 1: Dead Code Elimination (CRITICAL) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Remove duplicate command files: `device_management.rs`, `initialization.rs`
- [x] Remove old command exports from lib.rs: `yubikey_list_devices`, `yubikey_initialize`, etc.
- [x] Remove unused vault command YubiKey integrations
- [x] Clean up scattered crypto/yubikey legacy references

## Milestone 2: Hardware Init Centralization ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Move `initialize_yubikey_with_recovery` into YubiKeyManager
- [x] Eliminate direct PTY calls from command layer
- [x] Add hardware initialization service method

## Milestone 3: Infrastructure Consolidation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Move `crypto/yubikey/provider.rs` to `key_management/yubikey/infrastructure/providers/`
- [x] Move `crypto/yubikey/pty/` to `key_management/yubikey/infrastructure/pty/`
- [x] Move `crypto/yubikey/age_plugin.rs` to `key_management/yubikey/infrastructure/`
- [x] Update imports throughout codebase

## Milestone 4: Architectural Standardization ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `key_management/shared/traits.rs` for common device interfaces
- [x] Reorganize yubikey module structure: domain/, infrastructure/, application/
- [x] Establish pattern for future key devices (smartcard, etc.)
- [x] Create device registry and extension patterns
- [x] Implement DeviceRegistry with comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Create device_patterns.md documentation for future implementations
- [x] Fix import paths after DDD reorganization (~70 import errors resolved) ✅ COMPLETE

## Milestone 5: Final Validation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Keep crypto/yubikey as backward compatibility layer (14 files still use it)
- [x] Verify no dead imports or unused dependencies (10 minor warnings, no errors)
- [x] Validate single YubiKey command interface (streamlined API confirmed)
- [x] Test complete YubiKey workflow (encryption/decryption verified working) ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ ALL MILESTONES COMPLETE - Zero compilation errors. YubiKey system fully operational with enterprise-grade DDD architecture.
