# YubiKey Refactoring Project Plan

_Live tracking document for YubiKey technical debt refactoring in Barqly Vault_

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Systematically refactor YubiKey implementation from scattered code (57 backend + 41 frontend files) into centralized architecture using established design patterns

**Context**: YubiKey functionality works but suffers from severe technical debt:
- **57 backend files** + **41 frontend files** with YubiKey code
- **19 scattered public functions** across multiple modules
- **Duplicate implementations** causing recurring bugs (identity tag issue required fixes in 2+ locations)
- **No single source of truth** for any YubiKey operation

**Architecture Target**: Implement 6 design patterns (Facade, State Machine, Strategy, Repository, Factory, Observer) to create maintainable foundation

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Reduce YubiKey files: 98 → ~40 files (60% reduction)
- Reduce public functions: 19 → 6-8 functions (68% reduction)
- Eliminate duplications: 15+ → 0 duplications
- Test coverage: ~30% → 95%+
- Bug rate: 90% reduction in YubiKey-related bugs

### Qualitative Metrics
- Single source of truth for all operations
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to add new features
- Consistent behavior across all paths
- 100% backward compatibility maintained

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. **Fix compilation errors** (immediate)
2. **Create test baseline** (capture current behavior)
3. **Implement domain models** (foundation)
4. **Build services incrementally** (test after each)
5. **Integrate facade pattern** (orchestration)
6. **Update commands** (backward compatible)
7. **Clean up and optimize** (final polish)

### Testing Philosophy
- Test after EVERY change
- Maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes without migration path
- Incremental refactoring with validation

### Communication
- Update this plan daily with progress
- Document blockers immediately
- Test manually when requested
- Keep running `cargo test --lib` after each change

## Manual Testing Checkpoints

As requested, I will inform you when backend tests are passing and ready for manual testing at these key points:
1. After fixing compilation errors
2. After completing domain models
3. After implementing core services
4. After YubiKeyManager facade is ready
5. Before final integration

## Critical Bug Tracking & Architectural Requirements

### 🐛 **Active Bugs Discovered During Refactoring**

#### Bug #1: Slot Occupation Check Across Devices (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** 2025-09-24 - Fixed slot validation to check per-device instead of globally

**Issue**: When registering a new YubiKey, the system incorrectly reports "Slot 1 is already occupied" based on **global slot usage** rather than **device-specific slot usage**.

**Real-World Impact**:
- User has YubiKey A registered (using slot 1)
- User tries to register YubiKey B (which also has content in slot 1)
- System blocks registration with "Slot 1 is already occupied" error
- Should only check if slot 1 is available **on YubiKey B**

**Root Cause**: Scattered slot validation logic treats slots as global rather than device-specific

**Evidence from Logs**:
```
YubiKey ***3715 state: Orphaned (has identity but not in registry)
YubiKey ***0420 already registered in vault
register_yubikey_for_vault called | serial=***3715, slot_index=1
ERROR: Slot 1 is already occupied (incorrect global check)
```

**Files Involved**:
- `commands/vault_commands/yubikey_integration.rs` - slot validation logic
- Frontend registration flow - slot selection UI

**Fix Strategy**:
- Our new `YubiKeyDevice` domain model has proper `slots: Vec<SlotInfo>` per device
- New architecture will use `device.get_available_slot(SlotType::Age_Plugin)`
- Eliminates global slot confusion entirely

**Test Case for Verification**:
1. Register YubiKey A with slot 1 occupied
2. Connect YubiKey B with slot 1 also occupied
3. Registration should succeed (device-specific slots)

---

### 🎯 **Architectural Requirements (CRITICAL)**

#### Requirement #1: Serial-Scoped Operations
**MANDATORY**: All YubiKey operations MUST include `--serial` parameter to establish logical boundaries

**Rationale**:
- Prevents cross-device operation confusion
- Provides clear scope for all YubiKey commands
- Enables proper multi-device support
- Eliminates ambiguous operations

**Implementation Requirements**:

**Backend APIs**:
```rust
// ALL YubiKey functions must accept serial parameter
fn register_yubikey_for_vault(serial: &Serial, vault_id: &str, slot_index: u8)
fn yubikey_decrypt_file(serial: &Serial, file_path: &str, pin: &Pin)
fn get_identity_for_serial(serial: &Serial) // Already exists
fn check_yubikey_has_identity(serial: &Serial) // Already exists
```

**age-plugin-yubikey Commands**:
```bash
# Every command MUST include --serial
age-plugin-yubikey --identity --serial 15903715
age-plugin-yubikey --recipient --serial 15903715
age-plugin-yubikey --generate --serial 15903715
```

**Frontend State Management**:
```typescript
interface YubiKeyOperation {
  serial: string;  // REQUIRED for all operations
  operation: 'encrypt' | 'decrypt' | 'register' | 'check_status';
  // ... other params
}
```

**Validation Rules**:
- ❌ Any YubiKey operation without `serial` parameter should be rejected
- ❌ Any `age-plugin-yubikey` command without `--serial` should be rejected
- ✅ All operations scoped to specific device via serial number
- ✅ Clear error messages when serial not provided

**Migration Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Add serial parameter to all new service interfaces
- Phase 2: Update existing functions to require serial
- Phase 3: Remove any global YubiKey operations
- Phase 4: Frontend updates to always pass serial

---

### 📋 **Bug Fix Checklist**

**Pre-Service Layer (Week 1-2)**:
- [ ] Document all discovered bugs in this section
- [ ] Create test cases for each bug scenario
- [ ] Verify bugs exist in current codebase

**During Service Layer Implementation (Week 2-3)**:
- [ ] Ensure all service interfaces require `Serial` parameter
- [ ] Implement device-specific slot management
- [ ] Add validation for serial-scoped operations
- [ ] Create integration tests with multiple YubiKeys

**During Command Integration (Week 5)**:
- [ ] Fix slot occupation check in `yubikey_integration.rs`
- [ ] Update all `age-plugin-yubikey` calls to include `--serial`
- [ ] Add validation to reject operations without serial
- [ ] Update frontend to always provide serial parameter

**Verification Tests**:
- [ ] Multiple YubiKey registration with same slot occupied
- [ ] Cross-device operation isolation (operations on YubiKey A don't affect YubiKey B)
- [ ] Error handling for missing serial parameters
- [ ] End-to-end testing with 2+ YubiKeys connected

---

### 🔍 **Additional Bugs to Watch For**

Based on the architectural analysis, these bugs likely exist:

#### Potential Bug #2: Identity Tag Generation Duplicates
**Status**: Documented in baseline, needs verification
**Files**: `yubikey_integration.rs:150` and `:317`
**Impact**: Same logic implemented in multiple places

#### Potential Bug #3: State Detection Inconsistencies
**Status**: Suspected from duplicate enum usage
**Files**: Multiple state detection across scattered files
**Impact**: YubiKey state may differ between UI and backend

#### Potential Bug #4: Registry Entry Inconsistencies
**Status**: Suspected from scattered registry operations
**Files**: Registry operations across 4+ files
**Impact**: Registry entries may become inconsistent

**Action**: These will be systematically eliminated during refactoring phases.

#### Bug #5: UI Display Logic Using Wrong Lookup Method ✅
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** 2025-09-24 - Fixed frontend display logic to use array indexing

**Issue**: `KeyMenuBar.tsx` was using `getYubiKeyForSlot(slotIndex)` looking for non-existent `slot_index` property instead of simple array indexing.

**Real-World Impact**:
- Second registered YubiKey (YubiKey-1590) not displaying in UI
- Console logs showed all 3 keys loaded correctly
- UI only displayed 2 keys due to wrong lookup logic

**Root Cause**: Frontend component used PIV slot terminology (`slot_index`) for UI positioning instead of array indexing
```

**Result**: All registered YubiKeys now display correctly in the horizontal menu bar.
