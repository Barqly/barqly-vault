# YubiKey Refactoring Implementation Plan

**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Implementation Plan
**Parent**: [Technical Debt Analysis](./technical-debt-analysis.md)

## Overview

This document provides a detailed, phased implementation plan for refactoring the scattered YubiKey implementation into the centralized architecture design. The plan is structured to minimize risk, maintain functionality, and deliver incremental value.

## Executive Summary

**Scope**: Refactor 46 YubiKey-related files into ~20 organized components
**Timeline**: 6 weeks (30 working days)
**Risk Level**: Medium (mitigated by phased approach and comprehensive testing)
**Team Size**: 2-3 engineers
**Success Criteria**: Zero regression, 100% test coverage, single source of truth

## Pre-Refactoring Assessment

### Current State Analysis
- **46 files** contain YubiKey code
- **19 public functions** scattered across commands
- **15+ duplicate implementations** (identity tags, state detection, etc.)
- **Zero comprehensive tests** for YubiKey operations
- **Multiple execution paths** with different behaviors

### Risk Assessment
**High Risk Areas**:
- Identity tag operations (recent bug source)
- State detection logic (different behavior per path)
- Registry operations (data corruption risk)
- Temporary file management (resource leaks)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Comprehensive testing before any changes
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Parallel implementation with A/B testing
- Rollback plan for each phase
