# YubiKey Integration Project Plan

_Live tracking document for YubiKey feature implementation in Barqly Vault_

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Add YubiKey hardware authentication as an alternative/additional method to passphrase-only key protection, enabling users to choose between three protection modes: passphrase-only, YubiKey-only, or hybrid (both).

**Context**: Building on solid v0.1.0 foundation with age encryption's multi-recipient architecture, this integration leverages age-plugin-yubikey for hardware key operations while maintaining backward compatibility.

## User Experience Requirements

### Protection Mode Options
1. **Passphrase-only** (existing): Private key encrypted with passphrase
2. **YubiKey-only**: Vault encrypted directly to YubiKey public key (P-256 in PIV slot)
3. **Hybrid** (recommended): Both passphrase and YubiKey protection for redundancy

### Key User Flows
- **Setup**: Choose protection mode, initialize YubiKey if needed
- **Encrypt**: Works with any protection mode (uses public keys only)
- **Decrypt**: Smart selection of available unlock methods
- **Recovery**: Clear paths when hardware unavailable or lost

## Technical Architecture

### Core Changes Required

#### Backend (Rust)
- Integrate `age-plugin-yubikey` for hardware communication
- Implement multi-recipient encryption/decryption flows
- Create metadata v2.0 structure supporting multiple recipient types
- Add YubiKey detection and PIV slot management
- Ensure cross-platform plugin bundling

#### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Protection mode selection interface
- YubiKey management screens (registration, PIN entry)
- Smart unlock method selection during decrypt
- Error handling and recovery guidance

### Security Considerations
- YubiKey private key never leaves hardware (non-extractable)
- PIN + touch required for operations
- DEK still appears in host memory during active session
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing v0.1.0 vaults
