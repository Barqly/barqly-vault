# User Stories: Backup Verification System

## Epic: Secure Backup Verification for Bitcoin Custody

### Story 1: Automatic Verification Creation

**As a** Bitcoin family preparing inheritance documents  
**I want** my encrypted backups to automatically include verification information  
**So that** my family can trust the backup integrity when they need to recover my Bitcoin

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Verification report is created automatically during encryption without user intervention
- All encrypted files have SHA-256 hashes calculated and stored
- Digital signature is applied to the verification data
- Process completes without noticeable performance impact
- User sees confirmation that "security seal" was added to backup

**Priority:** Must Have  
**Story Points:** 5

### Story 2: Cloud Storage Confidence

**As a** Bitcoin user storing backups in multiple cloud locations  
**I want** to verify my backup hasn't been corrupted or tampered with  
**So that** I can trust cloud-stored recovery documents for Bitcoin inheritance

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Opening any backup automatically checks integrity and authenticity
- Clear visual indicator shows verification status (pass/fail)
- Specific error messages explain what type of issue was detected
- User can proceed with caution if verification fails, but with clear warnings
- Verification works regardless of which cloud service stored the backup

**Priority:** Must Have  
**Story Points:** 8

### Story 3: Professional Verification Workflow

**As a** Bitcoin professional helping clients with inheritance planning  
**I want** to provide verifiable proof that client backups are complete and unmodified  
**So that** clients have confidence in my backup procedures and can audit the process

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Verification report can be exported as a standalone file
- Report contains human-readable summary of backup contents
- Cryptographic proof allows third-party verification
- Report shows who created the backup and when
- Professional can share verification details without exposing encrypted content

**Priority:** Should Have  
**Story Points:** 5

### Story 4: Simple Backup Health Check

**As a** Bitcoin newcomer learning self-custody  
**I want** to easily check if my backup is working correctly  
**So that** I can catch problems before I need the backup for recovery

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- "Test Backup" feature allows verification without full decryption
- Results shown in simple pass/fail format with plain English explanations
- No technical jargon in user interface (no "manifest", "hash", "signature")
- Clear guidance on next steps if verification fails
- Educational content explains why verification matters

**Priority:** Should Have  
**Story Points:** 3

### Story 5: Attack Detection and Response

**As a** Bitcoin holder with substantial holdings  
**I want** to be immediately alerted if someone has tampered with my backup  
**So that** I can detect sophisticated attacks before they cause financial loss

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Any modification to encrypted backup is detected during decryption attempt
- Malicious replacement of entire backup files is prevented by signature verification
- Clear distinction between corruption (accident) and tampering (malicious)
- User is blocked from proceeding with tampered backup
- Guidance provided on how to restore from trusted backup copy

**Priority:** Must Have  
**Story Points:** 8

### Story 6: Legacy Backup Handling

**As a** user who created backups before verification was implemented  
**I want** to understand the security implications of my older backups  
**So that** I can decide whether to re-create them with verification enabled

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- System gracefully handles backups created without verification
- Clear messaging explains that older backups cannot be verified
- Option to upgrade old backups by re-encrypting with verification
- No breaking changes to existing backup restoration workflow
- Educational content explains benefits of verification for new backups

**Priority:** Must Have  
**Story Points:** 3

### Story 7: Verification Report Preview

**As a** detail-oriented Bitcoin user  
**I want** to preview what will be included in my backup's verification report  
**So that** I can confirm all important files are included before encrypting

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Optional preview shows list of files to be encrypted
- File sizes, counts, and total backup size displayed
- Preview available before commitment to encryption process
- User can modify file selection based on preview information
- Preview uses user-friendly language, not technical terms

**Priority:** Could Have  
**Story Points:** 2

### Story 8: Verification Failure Recovery

**As a** Bitcoin user whose backup verification fails  
**I want** clear guidance on what to do next  
**So that** I can recover my Bitcoin access without losing funds

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Different error messages for different types of verification failures
- Specific recovery steps provided for each failure type
- Option to attempt decryption despite verification failure (with warnings)
- Contact information for support if user cannot resolve issue
- Documentation on how to restore from alternative backup sources

**Priority:** Must Have  
**Story Points:** 5

## Story Mapping

### Phase 2 MVP (Must Have)

1. Automatic Verification Creation
2. Cloud Storage Confidence
3. Attack Detection and Response
4. Legacy Backup Handling
5. Verification Failure Recovery

### Phase 2 Enhancement (Should Have)

6. Professional Verification Workflow
7. Simple Backup Health Check

### Future Consideration (Could Have)
