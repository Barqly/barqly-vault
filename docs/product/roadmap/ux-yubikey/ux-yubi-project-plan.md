# YubiKey UX Implementation Project Plan

## Executive Summary
Complete implementation of the Unified Key Menu design system, transitioning from protection mode terminology to a vault-centric architecture with equal treatment of all keys (passphrase and YubiKey).

## Success Metrics
- Zero use of "protection mode" terminology in UI/code
- All vaults support 1 passphrase + up to 3 YubiKeys
- Successful encryption/decryption with any registered key
- Recovery flow completion in under 2 minutes
- modular code files with line of code 150-200 in frontend and 250-300 in backend code.
- Pass all security audit requirements
