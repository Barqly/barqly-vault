# Retrospective: Drag-Drop Issue - Context System Failure

**Date:** January 6, 2025  
**Issue:** Tauri v2 drag-and-drop functionality not working  
**Status:** âœ… Resolved (after significant time waste)  

---

## 1. What Went Well

**System Architect Role:** Eventually identified the root cause - using Tauri v1 APIs (`listen('tauri://file-drop')`) instead of Tauri v2 APIs (`getCurrentWebview().onDragDropEvent()`). The final solution using the correct webview API was clean, minimal, and worked immediately.

**Research Engineer Role:** Successfully found the correct Tauri v2 documentation showing the proper `onDragDropEvent()` API. The WebFetch tool was used effectively to access official Tauri documentation and understand the correct implementation.

**Code Quality:** The final implementation was clean and minimal (~270 lines vs 500+ lines of complex retry logic), using the correct modern API with proper error handling and clear logging.

**Problem Resolution:** Once the correct API was identified, the implementation worked perfectly on first try, providing actual file paths through drag-and-drop functionality.

## 2. What I Missed/Mistakes Made

**Ignored Established Documentation:** The project's `/docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md` clearly states "Use Tauri v2" but I used Tauri v1 APIs without checking existing project documentation first.

**Bypassed Context System:** Failed to follow the established context system outlined in `CLAUDE.md` and `/context.md`. Should have started with `/docs/architecture/context.md` as instructed, which would have led to the technology decisions document.

**Trial-and-Error Instead of Research-First:** Made multiple configuration changes (`dragDropEnabled` true/false flipping) without understanding the actual API requirements, wasting significant time on incorrect approaches.

**API Version Confusion:** Used outdated Tauri v1 event system (`listen()`) instead of researching the current Tauri v2 webview API, despite clear project documentation specifying v2.

**Added Unnecessary Complexity:** Implemented complex retry logic, error handling, and fallback mechanisms when the real issue was simply using the wrong API version.

## 3. How to Avoid These Mistakes

**Follow Context System Religiously:** Always start with `/context.md` for project overview, then check `/docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md` for tech stack requirements before implementing any features.

**Research Before Coding:** Read official documentation for the correct API version before implementation. In this case, should have verified Tauri v2 drag-drop APIs first.

**Check Existing Patterns:** Look for existing examples in the codebase using the same technologies before creating new implementations.

**Document-First Approach:** When encountering technology-specific issues, consult project technology decisions and architecture docs before external research.

**Avoid Configuration Trial-and-Error:** Understand the "why" behind configuration options through documentation rather than flipping settings randomly.

## 4. How You Can Help (Director/Manager)

**Enforce Context System Usage:** Require all agents to explicitly reference the context system navigation map and relevant documentation before starting any implementation work.

**Technology Decision Compliance:** Establish checks to ensure implementations align with documented technology decisions (e.g., Tauri v2 usage) before accepting solutions.

**Research-First Culture:** Encourage consulting project documentation and architecture decisions before external research or trial-and-error approaches.

**API Version Validation:** Require explicit validation that implementations use the correct versions of technologies as specified in the project's technology decisions.

**Time-Boxing Debugging:** Set time limits for debugging issues - if not resolved within reasonable time, mandate stepping back to review project documentation and architecture decisions.

## 5. Key Insights for You

**Context System Prevents Waste:** The established context system exists specifically to prevent this type of time waste. When followed properly, it would have led directly to the correct Tauri v2 API usage from the start.

**Technology Decisions Are Not Suggestions:** The `/docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md` document contains binding technical requirements. "Use Tauri v2" means all implementations must use v2 APIs, not v1 compatibility methods.

**Documentation Investment Pays Off:** The time invested in creating comprehensive project documentation (context system, technology decisions, architecture docs) was validated - it contained the exact information needed to solve this issue quickly.

**API Version Matters Significantly:** Modern frameworks often have breaking changes between major versions. Always verify API version compatibility before implementation.

**Simple Solutions Are Often Correct:** The working solution was dramatically simpler than the complex retry/fallback logic that was attempted. Sometimes the issue is using the wrong tool, not needing a more complex implementation.

**Process Adherence Scales:** As project complexity grows, following established processes (like the context system) becomes more critical, not less. Ad-hoc approaches become increasingly costly.

**Next:** All future implementations will start with context system consultation and technology decision validation to prevent similar time waste.
