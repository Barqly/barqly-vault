# Retrospectives Domain Context

> **Purpose**: Capture learnings, decisions, and evolution of the project  
> **Value**: Prevent repeating mistakes, preserve institutional knowledge  
> **Last Updated**: January 2025

## Overview

This domain contains the accumulated wisdom from our development journey. Each retrospective captures not just what went wrong, but more importantly, what we learned and how we adapted.

## Key Learnings Summary

### Technical Learnings

#### Testing Patterns
- **Mock isolation is critical** - Async operations must be properly mocked to prevent test flakiness
- **Context providers need validation** - React Context can fail silently without proper error boundaries
- **Test organization matters** - Hierarchical structure (unit/integration/smoke) beats embedded tests

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Debouncing is powerful** - 80-90% IPC reduction with simple timer-based debouncing
- **Lazy loading pays off** - Component lazy loading improves initial load significantly
- **Cache strategically** - LRU cache with TTL provided 86.7% performance improvement

### Process Learnings

#### Documentation as Code
- **Context system works** - 5-minute onboarding vs 25-35 minute reconstruction
- **Definition of Done matters** - Mandatory documentation updates ensure knowledge preservation
- **Archive incrementally** - Move completed work to archive to keep active docs lean

#### Development Workflow
- **Demo-first development** - Building in demo system first enables rapid iteration
- **Validation mirrors CI** - Local validation matching CI prevents integration surprises
- **Pre-commit hooks save time** - Catching issues before commit reduces rework

## Milestone Evolution

### Milestone 2: Core Modules
- Successfully implemented crypto, storage, and file_ops modules
- Age encryption library integration proved straightforward
- Rust's type system prevented many potential bugs

### Milestone 3: Tauri Bridge
- Command-based architecture scaled well
- TypeScript type generation from Rust invaluable
- Progress tracking required debouncing optimization

### Milestone 4: UI Implementation
- Three-screen approach (Setup/Encrypt/Decrypt) validated
- 90-second setup goal achieved through UX optimization
- Drag-and-drop implementation required Context API expertise

### Milestone 12: Quick Wins
- Security hardening completed (DevTools disabled, CSP enhanced)
- Performance optimizations yielded major improvements
- Development workflow automation reduced friction

## Critical Decisions That Shaped the Project

1. **Tauri v2 over Electron** - Smaller bundle, better security, native performance
2. **Age over GPG** - Simpler API, audited library, perfect for our use case
3. **React 19.1 + TypeScript** - Type safety crucial for financial security software
4. **Demo-first development** - Rapid iteration without breaking main app
5. **Context system** - Eliminated context reconstruction overhead

## Failure Recovery Patterns

### Test Suite Recovery
When tests drift from implementation:
1. Create baseline snapshot
2. Fix one test at a time
3. Validate incrementally
4. Full validation before declaring victory

### Context Drift Recovery
When documentation falls behind:
1. Review Definition of Done
2. Update project-plan.md first
3. Update domain contexts
4. Archive completed work

## Future Considerations

Based on our learnings, future development should:
- Maintain the demo-first development pattern
- Continue aggressive documentation archiving
- Preserve test isolation patterns
- Extend performance optimizations to backend
