# YubiKey Development Setup

This document tracks the YubiKey development environment setup.

## Installation Status
- age-plugin-yubikey: âœ… Installed and verified
- Version: $(age-plugin-yubikey --version 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
- Location: $(which age-plugin-yubikey 2>/dev/null || echo "not found")

## Testing YubiKey Features

### Without Physical YubiKey
For development without hardware, the age-plugin-yubikey will gracefully fail with proper error messages that our error handling system should catch and handle appropriately.

### With Physical YubiKey
1. Insert YubiKey device
2. Run the app: `make app`
3. Navigate to Setup page
4. Select YubiKey or Hybrid protection modes
5. Follow the initialization workflow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Binary not found**: Make sure age-plugin-yubikey is in PATH
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure proper permissions for binary execution
3. **YubiKey not detected**: Check physical connection and drivers

### Development Workflow
1. Test without YubiKey (should show graceful degradation)
2. Test with YubiKey inserted (should show device detection)
3. Test YubiKey removal during operation (should handle gracefully)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement proper error classification system
- [ ] Add graceful degradation for missing plugin
- [ ] Implement production binary bundling strategy
