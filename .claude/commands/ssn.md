✅ Ready to continue! Would you like me to:

## Important

- Do NOT start coding immediately
- Do NOT make file changes without confirmation
- DO wait for user direction
- DO be ready to adjust based on user's current priorities
- The user might want to pivot or address something different first
- If multiple quick start files exist, use the most recent one
