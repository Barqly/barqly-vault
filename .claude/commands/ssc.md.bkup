# Session Checkpoint - Mid-Session Snapshot

Create a checkpoint to preserve progress without ending the session.

## Instructions

Create a checkpoint file with the following specifications:

1. **Filename Format**: `ssc{DD}{MM}.{n}.md` where:
   - DD = day of month (01-31)
   - MM = month (01-12)
   - n = counter (1, 2, 3...) for multiple checkpoints in a day

2. **Location**: Save in `./tbd/` folder (create if it doesn't exist)

3. **Purpose**: Save progress mid-session to prevent context loss, create restore points during complex work

## Template

```markdown
# Session Checkpoint #{n}
**Date:** [Timestamp]
**File:** ssc{DD}{MM}.{n}.md
**Session Status:** In Progress

## Execution

When creating the checkpoint:
1. This is a CHECKPOINT, not a full summary
2. Keep it brief - just enough to resume work if interrupted
3. Focus on STATE rather than history
4. Include only the most recent/relevant code
5. Can create multiple checkpoints in one session
6. Each checkpoint is a snapshot at that moment in time

After creating, show the file path and confirm checkpoint saved. Remind that work continues without interruption.
