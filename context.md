# Barqly Vault - Master Context

_Your 2-minute orientation to the secure data vault system_

## What This Is

**Barqly Vault** - Desktop application for secure backup and restore of sensitive data & documents. Strong encryption running locally on your machine.

**Core Mission**: Enable secure data backup in under 90 seconds, recoverable decades later.

## Current State (January 2025)

- âœ… **Alpha Release Complete** - Three functional screens (Setup, Encrypt, Decrypt)
- âœ… **Core encryption** - Age encryption with passphrase protection
- âœ… **Key management** - Generate, store, manage encryption keys
- âœ… **File operations** - Encrypt/decrypt files and folders with manifest preservation
- âœ… **Cross-platform** - macOS, Windows, Linux via Tauri v2
- âœ… **UI/UX Implementation** - All three core screens with 90-second setup goal achieved
- âœ… **UI Consistency Optimization** - Visual and functional refinement across all screens
- ðŸ“‹ **Next up** - Testing & QA, performance optimization, hardware wallet integration

## Technical Stack

```yaml
frontend: "React 19.1 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui"
backend: "Rust Edition 2024 + Tauri v2 + age-encryption"
testing: "Vitest (frontend) + Rust tests (backend)"
platform: "Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)"
security: "Age encryption, local-only, zero network"
```

## Project Structure

```
barqly-vault/
â”œâ”€â”€ src-ui/          # React frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ src-tauri/       # Rust backend
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/            # Domain-organized documentation

## Core Principles

1. **Security First** - Protect user assets above all
2. **90-Second Goal** - Critical operations under 90 seconds
3. **Local-Only** - No mandatory network, user owns data
4. **Universal** - Works with any sensitive files including Bitcoin seeds, keys, documents
5. **Future-Proof** - Recoverable in 20+ years

## Essential Commands

```bash
make validate        # Before ANY commit - ensures CI passes
make validate-ui     # Frontend only (~30s)
make validate-rust   # Backend only (~1-2min)
make ui             # Start frontend dev server
make app            # Start Tauri desktop app
```

## Quality Gates

1. **Type Safety** - TypeScript strict, Rust compiler
2. **Linting** - ESLint, Prettier, Clippy
3. **Testing** - Unit, integration, smoke tests
4. **Security** - No exposed keys, memory zeroization
5. **Documentation** - ADDs for significant changes
