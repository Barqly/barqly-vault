# Barqly Vault - Master Context

*Your 2-minute orientation to the Bitcoin custody vault system*

## What This Is
**Barqly Vault** is a desktop application for secure file encryption, designed specifically for Bitcoin custody workflows. Think of it as a digital vault where private keys and sensitive documents are protected with military-grade encryption, all running locally on your machine.

**Core Mission**: Enable anyone to securely store Bitcoin keys and documents in under 90 seconds, with confidence that even decades later, they can recover their assets.

## Current State (January 2025)
- âœ… **Core encryption engine** - Age encryption with passphrase protection
- âœ… **Key management** - Generate, store, and manage encryption keys
- âœ… **File operations** - Encrypt files/folders into portable `.age` archives
- âœ… **Cross-platform** - macOS, Windows, Linux support via Tauri
- ðŸš§ **In progress** - Batch operations, key backup workflows
- ðŸ“‹ **Next up** - Hardware wallet integration, cloud backup options

## Technical Foundation

### Stack at a Glance
```
Frontend:  React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
Backend:   Rust + Tauri v2 + age-encryption
Testing:   Vitest (frontend) + Rust tests (backend)
Platform:  Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)
Security:  Age encryption, local-only, zero network dependency
```

### Project Structure
```
barqly-vault/
â”œâ”€â”€ src-ui/          # React frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ src-tauri/       # Rust backend
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/            # Domain-organized documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/         # Build and automation
â””â”€â”€ context.md       # You are here
```

## Core Principles

1. **Security First** - Every decision prioritizes protecting user assets
2. **90-Second Goal** - Critical operations must be completable in 90 seconds
3. **Local-Only** - No mandatory network operations, user owns their data
4. **Bitcoin-Ready** - Optimized for seed phrases, private keys, custody docs
5. **Future-Proof** - Files encrypted today must be recoverable in 20+ years

## Development Workflow

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Before ANY commit - ensures CI will pass
make validate

# Quick validation by domain
make validate-ui     # Frontend only (~30s)
make validate-rust   # Backend only (~1-2min)

# Development
make ui             # Start frontend dev server
make app            # Start Tauri desktop app
```

### Quality Gates
Every change must pass:
1. **Type Safety** - TypeScript strict mode, Rust compiler
2. **Linting** - ESLint, Prettier, Clippy
3. **Testing** - Unit, integration, and smoke tests
4. **Security** - No exposed keys, memory zeroization
5. **Documentation** - ADDs for significant changes

## How to Use This Context System

### For Fresh AI Chats
1. Start with this document for orientation
2. Navigate to relevant domain context based on task
3. Reference specific documents as needed
4. Check `/docs/retrospectives/` for historical decisions

### For Ongoing Work
1. Update domain contexts as you make changes
2. Document decisions in ADDs (`/docs/architecture/decisions/`)
3. Keep this master context current with state changes
4. Add learnings to retrospectives after significant milestones

### For Context Reconstruction
If you lose context or start fresh:
1. Read this document (2 minutes)
2. Read relevant domain context (3-5 minutes)
3. You're ready to work - no 25-minute reconstruction needed
