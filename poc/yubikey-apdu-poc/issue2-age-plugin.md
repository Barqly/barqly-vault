# age-plugin-yubikey PTY Issue - Updated Status

## Previous Understanding
We thought `age-plugin-yubikey` wasn't printing a PIN prompt, so we tried to send PIN after seeing "Generating key...". This was WRONG.

## Current Reality (from logs)

Looking at the actual output, the plugin DOES print a visible PIN prompt:
```
[2025-09-14T19:58:27Z INFO] Plugin is generating key...
[2025-09-14T19:58:28Z DEBUG] age-plugin-yubikey:
Enter PIN for YubiKey with serial 31310420 (default is 123456): 212121ey
```

The prompt appears AFTER "Generating key..." and our code now correctly waits for it and sends the PIN.

## The Current Problem

The test gets stuck at "Plugin is generating key..." step. From the debug logs, we can see:

1. ‚úÖ PIN/PUK changes work
2. ‚úÖ Management key is set successfully  
3. ‚úÖ PTY spawns age-plugin-yubikey
4. ‚úÖ Plugin prints "üîê Generating key..."
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è **STUCK HERE** - Not seeing "Enter PIN for YubiKey" prompt

## Why It's Stuck

Looking at the two test runs:

**Run 1 (when you see the prompt):**
- Shows the PIN prompt in the terminal
- But PIN is corrupted: `212121ey` instead of `212121`

**Run 2 (automated test):**
- Gets stuck at "Plugin is generating key..."
- Never shows the PIN prompt
- Process appears to hang

## Hypothesis

The issue might be that `age-plugin-yubikey` is detecting whether it's in a "real" PTY vs our emulated PTY and behaving differently:

1. **In real terminal (iTerm2)**: Shows the PIN prompt normally
2. **In our PTY**: Gets stuck before showing the prompt

This could be because:
- The PTY size/settings aren't quite right
- The plugin is doing additional TTY checks beyond just `isatty()`
- There's a race condition or buffering issue

## Current Code Logic

```rust
// Wait for PIN prompt
if l.contains("Enter PIN for YubiKey") {
    // Send PIN
    writeln!(writer, "{}", pin)?;
}
```

This is correct, but the prompt never appears in our PTY environment.

## Possible Solutions

### 1. Force unbuffered I/O
The plugin might be buffering its output. We could try:
- Setting environment variables like `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` (if it's Python-based)
- Using `stdbuf -o0` to force unbuffered output
- Flushing after every write

### 2. Send PIN blindly after delay
Since we know the plugin waits for PIN after "Generating key...":
```rust
if l.contains("Generating key") {
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
    writeln!(writer, "{}", pin)?;
    writer.flush()?;
}
```

### 3. Use different PTY settings
Try different PTY configurations:
```rust
PtySize {
    rows: 80,    // Try larger
    cols: 120,   // Try larger
    pixel_width: 800,
    pixel_height: 600,
}
```

### 4. Check for hidden prompts
The prompt might be using special terminal codes that don't appear in our line-by-line reading. We could:
- Read raw bytes instead of lines
- Look for specific byte sequences
- Use a more sophisticated terminal emulator

## The PIN Corruption Issue

In your manual test, the PIN shows as `212121ey` instead of `212121`. This suggests:
- Text from "Generating key..." is bleeding into the PIN input
- There might be a timing issue where we send PIN too early
- Terminal echo/buffering issues

## Next Steps

1. Try sending PIN blindly after "Generating key..." with a delay
2. Add more detailed logging to see exactly what bytes we're reading from PTY
3. Test with different PTY configurations
4. Consider using `expect`-style library that handles PTY interactions better

## Key Question for ChatGPT

The fundamental issue is: **Why does `age-plugin-yubikey` show the PIN prompt in a real terminal (iTerm2) but not in our portable-pty PTY?** What TTY features or settings might be missing that cause the plugin to get stuck before showing the prompt?
